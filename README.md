# Stat 21: Introduction to Statistical Methods 2

Here is an example [syllabus](https://dr-suz.github.io/Stat21/Stat21_S22/S22-Syllabus.pdf) and [calendar](https://dr-suz.github.io/Stat21/Stat21_S22/S22-Student-Calendar.pdf). 

This is the second in a series of introductory, undergraduate statistics courses. The course is an application-focused introduction to statistical modeling. For this course, students are required to use RStudio and the topics covered can be broken into three units. Unit 1 introduces RStudio and simple linear regression (SLR), Unit 2 introduces multiple linear regression (MLR), and Unit 3 explores ethical statistical modeling practices and analysis of variance (ANOVA) models.
