NAME: Normal Body Temperature, Right or left handedness, and Heart Rate 
TYPE: Random sample
SIZE: 130 observations, 3 variables 

DESCRIPTIVE ABSTRACT:
This data set is adapted data found in a paper of the _Journal of the American
Medical Association_ that examined whether the true mean body
temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. The original data studied "Gender" rather than "handedness" but treated it as a binary variable. For educational purposes I have changed the data to use a variable that actually is binary instead. Therefore, keep in mind that this is somewhat artificial data. 

SOURCE:
These data are derived from a dataset presented in Mackowiak, P. A.,
Wasserman, S. S., and Levine, M. M.  (1992), "A Critical Appraisal of
98.6 Degrees F, the Upper Limit of the Normal Body Temperature, and
Other Legacies of Carl Reinhold August Wunderlich," _Journal of the
American Medical Association_, 268, 1578-1580.
