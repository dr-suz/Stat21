NAME:  Simpson Stand Ground 2015
TYPE:  Census (mostly)
SIZE:  220 observations, 4 variables

DESCRIPTIVE ABSTRACT:
The Tampa Bay Times created a webpage on which they presented data
on criminal cases in Florida in which the defendant use Florida’s 
Stand Your Ground law as part of their defense. The race of the 
victim and of the defendant are recorded, along with the outcome
(conviction or acquittal).

VARIABLE DESCRIPTIONS:
Column Variable
  1    Convicted? Yes or No
  2    Race of the defendant (Accused) White or Minority
  3    Was the victim white?  1 = white victim, 0 = minority victim
  4    Was the victim a minority?  1 = minority victim, 0 = white victim


NOTE:
The website gives three races: white, black, and Hispanic. In the data 
file “minority” means black or Hispanic. Also, the website classifies
cases as fatal or nonfatal; the data file includes all fatal and nonfatal
cases for which full information was available. The  website includes a
note that the data are incomplete (but are the most comprehensive list
in the state.) The data cover 2005 through early 2013 (at which point
the newspaper stopped updating the website).

PEDAGOGICAL NOTES:
These data can be used to illustrate Simpson’s Paradox: Ignoring the race
of the victim gives a higher conviction rate for white than for minority
defendants. Controlling for victim’s race reverses this inequality. One
could also use these data when teaching logistic regression.
