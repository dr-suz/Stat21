</H2>
       
<P>  The CIGARETTE dataset contains measurements of          weight and
tar, nicotine, and carbon monoxide          content for 25 brands of
domestic cigarettes.  The          dataset is useful for introducing the
ideas of          multiple regression and provides examples of an       
  outlier and a pair of collinear variables.

<H1>   1.  Introduction</H1>

<P>1    The Federal Trade Commission annually rates varieties of     
domestic cigarettes according to their tar, nicotine, and      carbon
monoxide content.  The United States Surgeon General      considers each
of these substances hazardous to a smoker's      health.  Past studies
have shown that increases in the tar      and nicotine content of a
cigarette are accompanied by an      increase in the carbon monoxide
emitted from the cigarette      smoke.
</P>
<P>2    The dataset presented here contains measurements of weight     
and tar, nicotine, and carbon monoxide (CO) content for 25      brands
of cigarettes.  Students familiar with simple linear      regression can
use these data to develop an understanding of      multiple regression
techniques.  Students will discover that      there is an outlier in
this dataset (where we define an      outlier as a point not near the
rest of the data) and that      tar and nicotine are collinear
variables.  These      characteristics of the data can lead to a very
good      discussion and an enhanced understanding of regression when   
  introduced carefully in class.
</P>
<P>3    The data were taken from <A HREF="#mendenhall">Mendenhall and
Sincich (1992)</a>.  The      original source of the data is the Federal
Trade Commission.      We use the dataset as part of a computer
demonstration.  We      lead the students into a discussion of the
outlying point,      collinearity, and multiple regression, using a
question and      answer format.  This paper presents a summary of the
data      presentation.
</P>


                 
<H1>  2.  The Computer Demonstration</H1>

<P>4    Our demonstration involves two people -- an instructor who     
presents the lecture and initiates discussion, and another      who
operates the computer.  We use the software SAS Insight.      (SAS and
SAS Insight are Registered Trademarks of SAS      Institute, Cary, NC.) 
An overhead LCD panel/projection      system displays the graphics and
analyses on a wall screen.
</P>
<P>5    First we introduce the dataset and ask students how they     
would analyze the data.  Past studies have shown that      increases in
the tar and nicotine content of a cigarette are      accompanied by an
increase in the carbon monoxide emitted      from the cigarette smoke. 
This information motivates our      goal of predicting the variable CO. 
The preliminary      analysis involves two simple linear regressions. 
We find it      helpful to place the models for the simple linear     
regressions on the blackboard.  We plot the data and perform      the
two regressions.  Each plot (CO*Tar and CO*Nicotine)      shows a
positive linear relationship.  Both regressions have      slopes that
are significantly larger than zero.
</P>
<P> 6    From these simple analyses it is easy to motivate the use of  
    multiple regression, using the variables tar and nicotine      
simultaneously.  We give a short description of the multiple      
regression model.  We also give other examples in which       multiple
regression is extremely useful, such as crime       prediction and
economic forecasts.
</P>
<P> 7    Next the real fun begins.  SAS Insight has a rotating      
three-dimensional plotting option that allows students to       really
see and grasp the concept of a multiple regression in       two
dimensions.  We identify simple regression as a line,       this
multiple regression as a plane, and note that more       variables would
involve a higher than three-dimensional       space.
</P>
<P> 8    The three-dimensional picture clearly shows an outlier,      
which we highlight.  We run the multiple regression and       notice two
interesting developments:  the coefficient of       nicotine has changed
sign, and it is no longer significant.       We let students discover
and discuss these unexpected       results.  At this point, we examine
the outlier.  We       determine that the Bull Durham cigarette
(observation 3) has       more tar and nicotine than the others.  After
emphasizing       that the exclusion of an outlier requires a good
reason, we       redo the analysis excluding the outlier.  Removal of
the       outlier results in positive slopes for tar and nicotine, as   
   observed in the simple linear regressions, but the       coefficient
of nicotine is still not significant.
</P>
<P> 9    The non-significance of the nicotine coefficient is a      
concern, and we ask students to suppose that the two       independent
variables, tar and nicotine, are related.  Is       this good or bad? 
With prompting, students can see that       having highly correlated
independent variables is not       desirable from the point of view of
statistical accuracy.       In addition, the use of redundant
independent variables       could waste time and money on unnecessary
data collection.
</P>
<P>10    We investigate the correlation between tar and nicotine and   
   discover that tar and nicotine are highly correlated, and       that
each is correlated with CO.  From this we conclude that       there is a
strong relationship between the independent       variables, and that
only one of these variables should be       used as a predictor of CO.
</P>
<P>11    This provides an opportunity to talk about the importance of  
    understanding the variables.  The source of the carbon in       the
CO gas is relevant here.  Also, there is controversy       over the
methods used to obtain these data by the Federal       Trade Commission
(FTC).  Some studies (<A HREF="#davis">Davis et al. 1990</A>,      <A HREF="#coultas"
> Coultas et al. 1993</A>) have indicated that the tar, nicotine,      
and carbon monoxide content measured via smoking machines       (as used
to gather this dataset) may have little to do with       actual human
exposure to these chemicals.  In other words,       the relationship
between the FTC cigarette data and       biological markers of nicotine
and tar uptake in humans is       weak.  These studies recommend that
smokers be warned that       the content of tar and nicotine given in
cigarette       advertisements may not reflect the relative strengths of
      cigarette brands.  One factor in this human dilemma is that      
people smoking `lighter' brands, i.e., brands lower in       labelled
tar and nicotine, may smoke more cigarettes or       inhale for longer
periods than if they smoked cigarettes       with higher contents of tar
and nicotine.
</P>
<P>12    These data help students understand multiple regression.      
The data analysis clearly demonstrates the concepts of       multiple
regression that students often find difficult.  We       have used this
dataset successfully in an undergraduate       introductory course for
non-statistics majors.  Others in       our department have used it at
the graduate level to       illustrate the dangers of collinearity.
