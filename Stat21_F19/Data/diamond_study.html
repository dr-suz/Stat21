<p> <h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>      Data presented in a newspaper advertisement
         suggest the use of simple linear regression to
         relate the prices of diamond rings to the weights
         of their diamond stones.  The intercept of the
         resulting regression line is negative and
         significantly different from zero.  This finding
         raises questions about an assumed pricing mechanism
         and motivates consideration of remedial actions.

<p>
<h1>1. Introduction</h1>


<p>1    Linear regression is covered in many introductory statistics
     courses.  The availability of statistical software makes it
     a popular topic with students.  However, students often fail
     to criticise the suitability of their fitted model.

<p>2    One example that I have used to illustrate this point
     concerns the relationship between the price and diamond
     caratage of ladies' diamond rings.  The application has
     significant mundane appeal to students who may be
     contemplating the purchase of such jewelry.


<p><h1>2. The Dataset</h1>


<p>3    The source of the data is a full page advertisement placed
     in the <cite>Straits Times</cite> newspaper issue of February 29, 1992,
     by a Singapore-based retailer of diamond jewelry.

<p>4    The advertisement contained pictures of diamond rings and
     listed their prices, diamond content, and gold purity.  Only
     20K ladies' rings, each mounted with a single diamond stone,
     were considered for this study.  20K rings are made with
     gold of 20 carat purity.  (Pure gold is rated as 24K.)

<p>5    There were 48 such rings of varying designs.  The weights of
     the diamond stones ranged from 0.12 to 0.35 carats (a one
     carat diamond stone weighs 0.2 gram) and were priced between
     $223 and $1086.  The jewelry store adopted a fixed-price
     policy.

<p>6    I distribute photocopies of the advertisement to pairs of
     students and ask them to use the data to uncover, interpret,
     and comment on a plausible mechanism for pricing the diamond
     rings.

<p>
<h1>3. How Is Jewelry Priced?</h1>

<p> 7    In Singapore, the pricing of gold jewelry is simple.  The
      price equals the current market value of the gold content
      (i.e., weight times the going rate per gram of gold) plus a
      craftsmanship fee.

<p> 8    However, the pricing of other jewelry like diamond rings is
      more complicated because they are not as standardized as
      gold jewelry.  The price of diamond jewelry depends on the
      four C's:  caratage, cut, colour, and clarity of the diamond
      stone.  A good cut gives a diamond more sparkle.  Colourless
      diamonds are the most prized.  A flawless diamond has
      maximum clarity because the passage of light is unimpeded
      through the stone.  Cut, colour, and clarity are subjective
      factors and are very hard for the layman to gauge.

<p>
<h1>4. Assumptions and Results</h1>

<p> 9    Students find it reasonable to assume that they are dealing
      with &quot;commercial grade&quot; jewelry intended for the mass
      market.  Such jewelry is similar in terms of design, gold
      weight, and the diamond qualities of cut, colour, and
      clarity.  Therefore, the carat size of the diamond stones
      becomes the obvious factor to use in pricing the rings.

<p>10    Examination of a scatter plot of the data suggests the
      viability of a simple linear regression (SLR) model; see 
      <a href="#Fig1">Figure 1</a>.  The
      fitted regression model is Estimated price = -259.63 +
      3721.02 (carats).  The fit is excellent as indicated by an
      R² of 0.978.  The t-statistics for the intercept and slope
      coefficients are -14.99 and 45.50, respectively.

<p>11    Students invariably employ an SLR model.  They also perform
      residual analysis, and, finding nothing unusual, they are
      satisfied with the regression fit.

<p>12    In their reports, the students commonly point out

<ul>
<p><li> the viability of the SLR model as ascertained by the
          R² value and the statistical significance of the slope
          coefficient,</li>

<p><li> the interpretation of the slope as the average imputed
          value per carat of diamond stones within the restricted
          range considered, and</li>

<p><li> the usefulness of the regression fit for predicting the
          price of diamond rings within this restricted range.</li>
</ul>

<p>13    Many students point out that extrapolation of the regression
      line for bigger diamond stones would not be advisable as
      these stones are rarer and command a different price range.
      A few students mention that they find the negative intercept
      puzzling because it suggests that a zero-carat diamond ring
      has a negative economic value!

<p>
<h1>5. Discussion</h1>

<p>14    Upon returning the assignments, I follow up on the remarks
      about the negative intercept and ask the students whether
      this warrants remedial action.  Our presumed pricing
      mechanism implies that the intercept represents the value of
      the gold content plus a craftsmanship fee.  Thus, it should
      be non-negative.  Three lines of thought have emerged during
      the discussions.</p>
<blockquote>
      Thought 1: No remedial action is required.  The model
          applies only to the restricted range of the data.
          Extrapolation to a zero-weight stone (i.e., to the
          intercept) is dangerous because the underlying pricing
          mechanism may be piecewise linear or even nonlinear.
          Thus the possibility that the true intercept is
          non-negative cannot be excluded.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
      Thought 2: Remedial action is required.  One proposal is to
          force the regression line through the origin.  Some
          students, however, do not buy the idea that the gold
          content and craftsmanship fee are freebies.  A computer
          demonstration reveals that the fit is quite poor.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
      Thought 3: Remedial action is required, and data
          transformations may be entertained.  Suitable models
          that are intrinsically linear and have a non-negative
          intercept include $y = A x^B \epsilon$ and
          $y = \exp(A + Bx + \epsilon)$.  For the latter model,
          ln(price) is regressed on diamond caratage using
          standard SLR technology.  Our attempt at fitting that
          model turned out to be unsatisfactory; the residuals
          scattered along a dome pattern, cycling from negative
          to positive and back to negative as the carat size
          increased.  This led us to consider the model
          $y = \exp(A + Bx + Cx² + \epsilon)$.  This proved to
          be an adequate model; the residuals scattered randomly,
          and the adjusted R² was 0.97.  The estimated fit was
          ln(price) = 3.89 + 14.86 (carats) - 17.54 (carats²).
          The anti-log of the intercept is $49.  This is a
          reasonable figure for the value of the gold content and
          the craftsmanship fee.  Figure 1 shows this model after
          back-transforming price from the log scale.</blockquote>

<h1>6. Conclusion</h1>

<p>15    This paper illustrates model-building in linear regression.
      It is shown that a possibly counter-intuitive negative
      intercept may be avoided by using a multiplicative or
      exponential regression model.  These regression models are
      intrinsically linear, and they are estimated using standard
      linear regression technology after a suitable transformation
      of the data.
