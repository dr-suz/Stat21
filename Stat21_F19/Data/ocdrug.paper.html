<h2>Abstract</h2>  <P> 

This article focuses on a two treatment, two period, two treatment sequence crossover drug interaction study of a new drug and 
a standard oral contraceptive therapy.  Both normal theory and distribution-free statistical analyses are provided along with 
a notable amount of graphical insight into the dataset.  For one of the variables, the decision on the presence or absence of 
a drug interaction is reversed depending on whether the normal theory or the distribution-free analysis is favored.  The data 
also contain statistically significant period effects, statistically significant but clinically unimportant treatment effects, 
some modest degree of structural nonnormality; and modest to more extreme outliers.  This and 28 other pedagogically useful 
datasets can be found at  <A HREF="v12n1/bradstreet_link1.html">www.math.iup.edu/~tshort/Bradstreet</A>. </P>

<H2>1. Introduction</H2>  <P> 
In the pharmaceutical industry, following the evaluation of new drugs in animals, testing in humans begins in Phase I clinical 
pharmacology studies which typically are conducted in healthy subjects.   For a few diseases  (such as cancer and AIDS) 
patients may be used initially.  It is important to evaluate to what degree, if any, that a new drug interacts with food  
(<A HREF="v12n1/datasets.bradstreet.html#bradstreet2000">Bradstreet 2000</A>), alcohol, or other drugs.  In the study 
presented, the interest was in determining whether a new asthma drug, Drug D, altered the presence in the blood of an 
established oral contraceptive therapy when the two therapies were taken together. </P>  <P> This dataset can be used in 
relatively sophisticated statistics courses which emphasize either biostatistics, statistical methods in clinical trials, 
data analysis, or experimental design.  The subject matter is of interest and is accessible to faculty, and both statistics 
and nonstatistics students.  The level of study detail and statistical analyses which should be transferred to the classroom 
is dependent upon the students’ needs,  for example, more detail and more sophisticated statistical analyses and diagnostic 
work for graduate level biostatistics or statistics students, and less detail and less sophisticated statistical analyses and 
diagnostic work for undergraduate service course students.  This and 28 other pedagogically useful datasets can be found at

<H2>2. Bioavailability, Interaction Studies, and Bioequivalence</H2>  
<A NAME="section21"> 
<H3>2.1 Bioavailability</H3>  
<P> Bioavailability is defined as "the rate and extent to which the active ingredient or active moiety [portion] is 
absorbed from a drug product and becomes available at the site of action" in the human body  
(<A HREF="v12n1/datasets.bradstreet.html#fda2000">Food and Drug Administration 2000</A>, p. 3).  The bioavailability of a 
drug is characterized by summarizing its time course in the blood.  It is assumed that the concentrations in the blood are 
representative of the concentrations at the site of action.  After a drug is given to a subject, plasma samples are taken 
at previously determined time points.  The plasma samples are then assayed individually for drug concentration levels, and 
a plot of the plasma concentration  (<I>y</I>-axis) vs. time  (<I>x</I>-axis) curve is constructed.  Usually, the plasma 
concentration vs. time curve is summarized by three variables:  (i) Area Under the plasma Concentration vs. time curve 
(AUC), a measure of total absorption; (ii) maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), a measure of the extent of absorption; and 
(iii) time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax), a measure of the rate of absorption.  Most often, AUC and Cmax are the 
primary summary measures of bioavailability.  AUC is estimated from zero hours to the last measured time point  
(for example, 24 hours after dosing) using the linear trapezoidal rule  (<A HREF="v12n1/datasets.bradstreet.html#gibaldi1982">Gibaldi and Perrier 1982</A>; 
pp. 445-447), and if necessary, extrapolated from the last measured time point to infinity by incorporating the elimination 
rate constant which describes the rate of drug removal from the body  (<A HREF="v12n1/datasets.bradstreet.html#gibaldi1982">Gibaldi and Perrier 1982</A>; 
pp. 447-448).  Cmax and Tmax are simply observed from the plasma concentration vs. time curve. </P>  
<A NAME="section22"> 
<H3>2.2 Interaction Studies</H3>  
<P> It should be emphasized that the primary objective of an interaction study is to "prove" the absence of interaction.  
This focus is quite different statistically from the frequentist hypothesis testing paradigm which many statisticians are 
initially trained to consider.  Typically, we start with the null hypothesis of "no difference" and then we proceed to work 
quite hard either to provide statistical evidence against the null case (Fisher's significance testing), or we attempt to 
choose between the null and alternative hypotheses with maximal power for a certain size test procedure (Neyman-Pearson 
hypothesis testing).  However, in interaction studies, it is assumed initially that some degree of interaction exists 
(a nonzero difference), and it is the objective of the experimenters to show that the size of the interaction is not of 
clinical importance, possibly being zero.  In the current drug interaction study, the interest was in demonstrating that 
the AUC and Cmax of the oral contraceptive are relatively unchanged, within reasonable clinical allowance, when Drug D is 
given concomitantly.  If this is indeed the case, then giving Drug D with the oral contraceptive (OCD) is said to be 
bioequivalent to giving the oral contraceptive alone (OC). </P>  
<A NAME="section23"> 
<H3>2.3 Bioequivalence</H3>  <P> Bioequivalence is defined as "the absence of a significant difference in the rate and 
extent to which the active ingredient or active moiety in pharmaceutical equivalents or pharmaceutical alternatives becomes 
available at the site of drug action when administered at the same molar dose under similar conditions in an appropriately 
designed study"  (<A HREF="v12n1/datasets.bradstreet.html#fda2000">Food and Drug Administration 2000</A>; p. 4).  There are 
three categories of criteria by which bioequivalence could be evaluated:  average bioequivalence, population bioequivalence, 
and individual bioequivalence.  The former is the currently favored regulatory criterion for most drugs and formulations  
(<A HREF="v12n1/datasets.bradstreet.html#fda2000">Food and Drug Administration 2000</A>; p. 11); the latter two are 
criteria which are under development and serious consideration by several groups of scientists  
(<A HREF="v12n1/datasets.bradstreet.html#fda1999">Food and Drug Administration, 1999</A>).  This article follows the 
average bioequivalence evaluation paradigm. </P>  <P> In many countries, the current regulatory criterion for establishing 
average bioequivalence is by way of the so-called "20% rule."  Two treatment regimens are considered bioequivalent if their
 true mean AUCs are within 20% of each other.  In our example, the true mean AUC for the oral contraceptive when Drug D is 
administered concomitantly,  <IMG SRC="v12n1/images/muOCD.gif" ALT="mu_OCD">, should be within 20% of the true mean AUC 
when the oral contraceptive is given alone, <IMG SRC="v12n1/images/muOC.gif" ALT="mu_OC">, i.e., their ratio,  
<IMG SRC="v12n1/images/muOCD.gif" ALT="mu_OCD"> / <IMG SRC="v12n1/images/muOC.gif" ALT="mu_OC">, falls in the interval 
[0.80, 1.25]  (<A HREF="v12n1/datasets.bradstreet.html#fda1999">Food and Drug Administration 1999</A>; pp. 2, 3).  The 
lower end of this average bioequivalence interval addresses equivalent efficacy; the upper end reflects on the concern for 
equivalent safety.  The upper end of the interval is extended to 1.25 so that the interval on the log scale is symmetric 
about zero.   </P>  <P> Currently, the most popular approach for establishing average bioequivalence is a two one-sided 
hypothesis testing procedure  (<A HREF="v12n1/datasets.bradstreet.html#fda1999">Food and Drug Administration 1999</A>; pp. 2, 3) 
which is equivalent to a confidence interval approach  (<A HREF="v12n1/datasets.bradstreet.html#fda1999">Food and Drug Administration 1999</A>; 
p. 11).  Regulatory agencies typically require that bioequivalence be concluded with a reasonable degree of assurance.  For 
example, in the United States a 90% confidence interval is required.  Two treatment conditions are declared as bioequivalent 
if the calculated 90% confidence interval for the true ratio of means falls between 0.80 and 1.25  
(<A HREF="v12n1/datasets.bradstreet.html#fda1999">Food and Drug Administration 1999</A>; pp. 3, 5, 6, 11).  AUC and Cmax 
are natural log transformed prior to statistical analysis  (<A HREF="v12n1/datasets.bradstreet.html#fda1999">Food and Drug Administration 1999</A>; 
pp. 3, 4, 10, 11, D-1, D-2) for many reasons, among them are:  multiplicative pharmacokinetic models, the bioequivalence 
criterion compares the treatment conditions proportionally, and generally the log-transformed data appear to more closely 
follow a normal distribution. </P>  <P> A reader who is interested in more examples and exploring further the issues and 
methods used in establishing bioequivalence should see the manuscripts by  <A HREF="v12n1/datasets.bradstreet.html#bradstreet1993">Bradstreet (1993)</A>

<H2>3.  The Study</H2>  
<A NAME="section31"> 
<H3>3.1 Motivation for the Study</H3>  <P> There have been reports that some drugs can enhance the metabolism of oral 
contraceptives and result in pregnancy in some women.  A study was planned to evaluate the impact of the oral dosing of 
125 milligrams (mg) of a new drug for asthma, Drug D, given twice daily, on the bioavailability of the components of a 
standard oral contraceptive combination of 35 micrograms (mcg) of ethinyl estradiol (EE) and 1 milligram (mg) of 
norethindrone (NET).  It was conjectured that Drug D given concomitantly with the EE and NET combination would not have any 
clinically significant effect on either the AUC (in picograms times hours per milliliter; pg*hr/ml) or Cmax (in picograms 
per milliliter; pg/ml) of either EE or NET.  Specifically, it was predetermined that the coadministration of the oral 
contraceptive and Drug D (OCD) would be considered clinically similar to the oral contraceptive alone (OC) if the experimental 
evidence suggested that there is a 20% or less difference in the true mean values, OCD vs. OC, for each of EE AUC, EE Cmax, 
NET AUC, and NET Cmax. </P>  <A NAME="section32"> <H3>3.2 Study Conduct</H3>  <P> Twenty-two female subjects were allocated 
randomly to one of two treatment sequences in a 2,2,2 crossover design.  The study was conducted over two consecutive 
menstrual cycles for each subject.  The first treatment period corresponded with the first menstrual cycle; the second 
treatment period corresponded with the second menstrual cycle. </P>  <P> During the first treatment period, each female 
subject received either 125 mg of Drug D or a matching placebo tablet two times daily for eight days (16 doses) starting 
with either Day 1, 2, 3, or 4 of her menstrual cycle as was convenient for the subject.  The oral contraceptive 
administration always started on Day 1 of her menstrual cycle.  On the morning of the eighth day of taking either Drug D or 
placebo, the female subject took her dose of either Drug D or placebo and also the oral contraceptive.  Blood samples were 
drawn immediately prior to dosing and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 hours after dosing.  The quantities of 
EE and NET present at each time point were assayed from the plasma samples, and these assay values were used to construct 
separate plasma concentration vs. time curves for EE and NET for each subject.  From the two curves, AUC (pg*hr/ml) and 
Cmax (pg/ml) values were calculated.  During the second treatment period, this process was repeated with each female subject 
receiving whichever treatment, either 125 mg of Drug D or placebo, that she had not received during the first treatment 
period.  The oral contraceptive was again started on Day 1 of her menstrual cycle; Drug D or placebo was started on the 
same relative day (1, 2, 3, or 4) as during her previous menstrual cycle.  As an example, the four plasma concentration vs. 
time curves constructed for Subject 8 are shown in  <A HREF="v12n1/datasets.bradstreet.html#figure1">Figure 1</A>. </P>

combination of EE and NET in the first study period, followed by matching placebo and the oral contraceptive in the second 
study period (treatment sequence 1).  The other eleven (numbers 1, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 22) received matching 
placebo and the oral contraceptive during the first study period followed by Drug D given concomitantly with the oral 
contraceptive in the second study period (treatment sequence 2). </P>  
<A NAME="section4"> 
<H2>4. The Data</H2>  <P> 
The dataset contains several pieces of information about the study.  For each female subject, there are two lines of data 
which display the AUC (pg*hr/ml) and Cmax (pg/ml) values which were calculated and observed from the plasma concentration 
vs. time curves for both EE and NET.  The details of which treatments (Drug D or placebo) were taken concomitantly with the 
oral contraceptive in each treatment period (first or second) are also provided.  For example, female Subject 8 received 
Drug D in the first treatment period and placebo in the second treatment period (treatment sequence 1).  The AUC values 
calculated for EE and NET were 3,328.1 and 118,340.0 pg*hr/ml when she received Drug D during the first treatment period; 
the corresponding values in the second period following treatment with placebo were 2,941.4 and 148,220.0 pg*hr/ml, 
respectively.  The observed Cmax values were 431 and 18,100 pg/ml for Drug D; they were 302 and 24,200 pg/ml for placebo.

<A NAME="section5"> 
<H2>5. Data Analyses</H2>  
<A NAME="section51"> 
<H3>5.1 Initial Exploration of the Data</H3>  
<P> An informative first look at the data can be achieved by constructing three groups of graphics:  hanging dot plots of 
individual subject ratios, individual subject profile (sometimes called "spaghetti") plots, and scatter plots. </P>  <P> 
<B>Hanging Dot Plots of Individual Subject Ratios</B> </P>  <P> <A HREF="v12n1/datasets.bradstreet.html#figure2">Figure 2</A> 
presents individual within-subject natural log transformed ratios, log OCD/OC, of the AUC and Cmax data for EE and NET.  
The  <I>y</I>-axis is labeled with antilog values.  The target bioequivalence (interaction) limits are indicated by the 
horizontal dotted lines located at 0.8 and 1.25 on the  <I>y</I>-axis.  If the two treatments, OCD and OC, are bioequivalent, 
then it is reasonable to expect the individual ratios to cluster somewhere between 0.8 and 1.25.   
<A HREF="v12n1/datasets.bradstreet.html#figure2">Figure 2</A> suggests that when Drug D is given concomitantly with the 
oral contraceptive, EE AUC is increased for most individuals, often by more than 20%; EE Cmax is increased for many 
individuals, sometimes to a notable degree  (Subjects 2 and 20, for example); and NET Cmax is decreased for most 
individuals often by more than 20%, sometimes to a notable degree  (Subject 9, for example).  It also appears that NET AUC 
generally decreases in the subjects in treatment sequence 1 (OCD then OC), but generally increases among the subjects in 
treatment sequence 2 (OC then OCD).  But, as will be shown in the next section, this result is due to an unequal effect of 
the treatment periods and not due to a true sequence or subject group effect. </P>

The  <I>y</I>-axis is labeled with antilog values.  The  <I>y</I>-axes are all different.  In addition to providing 
within-subject information, these spaghetti plots provide important between-subject information such as the range of log 
AUC or log Cmax values observed, and indications of marginal location and marginal variances.  For example,  
<A HREF="v12n1/datasets.bradstreet.html#figure3">Figure 3c</A> suggests for each of Subjects 18, 22, and 20, that there is 
little difference between their log NET AUC value either with or without Drug D.  But, the log NET AUC values observed for 
Subjects 18 and 22 are many fold apart from those observed for Subject 20.   <A HREF="v12n1/datasets.bradstreet.html#figure3">Figure 3a</A> 
suggests that log EE AUC is marginally greater with Drug D than without Drug D since most of the lines are decreasing from 
left to right, but the marginal variances appear quite similar. </P>

<P> In addition to assessing the location of the bivariate point cloud vs. the diagonal line, it is important clinically 
to identify both concordant and discordant outliers.  In the bioequivalence framework, concordant outliers are those 
bivariate points close to the diagonal line but are notably distant from the point cloud, situated near either end of the 
diagonal line.  These points represent those subjects whose paired responses are somewhat similar for that subject, but are 
notably different (smaller - lower end of the diagonal line; larger - upper end of the diagonal line) than the magnitudes 
of the response of the other subjects.  Subject 12 in  <A HREF="v12n1/datasets.bradstreet.html#figure5">Figure 5b</A> and 
Subjects 20, 22, and 18 in  <A HREF="v12n1/datasets.bradstreet.html#figure5">Figure 5c</A> are concordant outliers.  
Discordant outliers are those bivariate points which stray from the point cloud and stray from the diagonal line.  These 
belong to subjects whose paired responses are not similar to each other for that subject, and are also notably different 
from the responses of the other subjects.  For example, Subjects 2 and 20 in  <A HREF="v12n1/datasets.bradstreet.html#figure5">Figure 5b</A>, 
and Subject 9 in  <A HREF="v12n1/datasets.bradstreet.html#figure5">Figure 5d</A>, are discordant outliers. </P>

<P> The normal theory mixed effects ANOVA for a 2,2,2 crossover study has three single degree of freedom contrasts:  one 
for unequal carryover effects; one for unequal period effects; and one for unequal treatment effects.  The contrast for 
unequal carryover effects is assessed against a between-subject error term; the other two are compared to within-subject 
variability  (<A HREF="v12n1/datasets.bradstreet.html#jones1989">Jones and Kenward 1989</A>; pp. 30-33).  The ANOVA results

<P><HR></P>  <P> An insightful presentation of the ANOVA includes a discussion of confounding.  In the 2,2,2 crossover

confounded in the single degree of freedom sum of squares which is tested against the between-subject error term  
(<A HREF="v12n1/datasets.bradstreet.html#jones1989">Jones and Kenward 1989</A>; pp. 39-51).  Some authors recommend against 
formally testing for the unequal carryover effect  (<A HREF="v12n1/datasets.bradstreet.html#senn1993">Senn 1993</A>; pp. 10-15, 
 <A HREF="v12n1/datasets.bradstreet.html#senn1997">Senn 1997</A>; pp. 239-247).  And, whether or not to treat the subject 
effect as either a fixed or random effect is a topic of debate. </P>  <P> The assessment of drug interaction is made by way 
of the average bioequivalence criterion using the single degree of freedom contrast for unequal treatment effects.  A 90% 
confidence interval is constructed based upon the observed estimate of the difference, OCD-OC, in the average log 
transformed values.  The geometric mean ratio (OCD/OC) estimate and the corresponding 90% confidence interval are calculated 
by exponentiation of the log scale results.  A summary of the interaction analysis is shown in

indicate that there is no clinically meaningful interaction for either log EE AUC, log EE Cmax, or log NET AUC, as the 
corresponding 90% confidence intervals are contained in the target bioequivalence interval of [0.8, 1.25].  However, there 
is some evidence that log EE AUC  (<I>p</I> < 0.0001) and log EE Cmax (<I>p</I> = 0.060) are elevated when Drug D is given 
with the oral contraceptive, as both of the lower limits of the corresponding 90% confidence intervals exceed 1.0.  There 
is a clinically meaningful decrease in log NET Cmax (<I>p</I> = .019) as the lower limit of the corresponding 90% 
confidence interval is less than 0.8 which is outside the target bioequivalence interval of [0.8, 1.25].  In addition, the 
upper limit is less than 1.0.  Given the outlying log EE Cmax data for Subjects 2 and 20 and the outlying log NET Cmax data 
for Subject 9 shown previously in  Figures  <A HREF="v12n1/datasets.bradstreet.html#figure2">2</A>,

is not surprising that the lengths of the 90% confidence intervals for log EE Cmax and log NET Cmax are longer than the 
corresponding confidence intervals for log EE AUC and log NET AUC.  The period effect for log NET AUC which was suggested 
by  <A HREF="v12n1/datasets.bradstreet.html#figure4">Figure 4</A> is confirmed (<I>p</I> < .0001) in  
<A HREF="v12n1/datasets.bradstreet.html#table1">Table 1</A>. </P>  <P> An interesting teaching point is to demonstrate that 
each of the single degree of freedom  <I>F</I>-tests is equivalent to a two sample t-test comparing the subjects in one 
treatment sequence with the subjects in the other treatment sequence with respect to linear combinations of the two data 
values collected for each subject  (<A HREF="v12n1/datasets.bradstreet.html#jones1989">Jones and Kenward 1989</A>; pp. 22-28).  
For example a difference between the two groups of subjects, sequence 1 (OCD then OC) minus sequence 2 (OC then OCD) in our 
study, in the mean within-subject sum of log AUC (or Cmax) values indicates an unequal carryover effect.  To test for 
unequal period effects, compare the mean within subject treatment difference, OCD-OC, of the log AUC (or Cmax) values.  To 
test for unequal treatment effects, compare the mean within subject period difference, period 1 - period 2 in our study, of 
the log AUC (or Cmax) values.  This equivalence can be used to visually evaluate the appropriateness of the normal theory 
ANOVA  (<A HREF="v12n1/datasets.bradstreet.html#section52">Section 5.2</A>) and to motivate and develop the 
distribution-free analysis of the 2,2,2 crossover design

there is an interesting twist in their construction for the 2,2,2 crossover design.  Because the residuals within a subject 
sum to zero, the residuals from the two treatment periods have the same magnitudes and opposite signs.  No additional 
information is gained from the second set of residuals. Therefore, plot the residuals from only one of the two treatment 
periods.  We used information from the first treatment period.   </P>  <P> Normal Probability Plots:

Study</H3>  <P> Given the suggestion of a modest degree of nonnormality for log EE Cmax, a sample size of only 22, and the 
presence of a few discordant outliers, most notably for log NET Cmax and log EE Cmax, a distribution-free statistical 
analysis of these data may be prudent. </P>  <P> A distribution-free statistical analysis of a 2,2,2 crossover study 
consists of a series of three Wilcoxon rank sum tests analogous to the three two sample  <I>t</I>-tests outlined in  
<A HREF="v12n1/datasets.bradstreet.html#section52">Section 5.2</A>.  For example, unequal treatment effects are evaluated 
using the Wilcoxon rank sum test to compare the two treatment sequence groups with respect to the within-subject period 
difference in the log AUC (or Cmax) values.  Drug interaction is assessed by way of the average bioequivalence criteria 
using the two sample Hodges-Lehmann point estimator and the two sample Moses confidence interval (see  
<A HREF="v12n1/datasets.bradstreet.html#hollander1973">Hollander and Wolfe 1973</A>, pp. 68-82;  
<A HREF="v12n1/datasets.bradstreet.html#koch1972">Koch 1972</A>;  
<A HREF="v12n1/datasets.bradstreet.html#jones1989">Jones and Kenward 1989</A>, pp. 51-59).  Note that the results from the 
calculation of the Hodges-Lehmann estimator and Moses confidence interval on the log scale must be divided by two before 
exponentiation to arrive at the correct estimate and confidence interval.  This is because the distribution-free comparison, 
sequence 1 (OCD then OC) minus sequence 2 (OC then OCD) in our study, between the two groups of within-subject paired 
differences (period 1 - period 2 in our study) of log AUC (or Cmax) values essentially counts the treatment difference 
twice.  That is, the distribution-free calculations give (OCD - OC) - (OC - OCD) = 2(OCD - OC), but we are interested in 
only OCD - OC.  No similar issue arises for the contrast using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test.  A few timely remarks about the 
scale invariance  (<A HREF="v12n1/datasets.bradstreet.html#mood1974">Mood, Graybill, and Boes 1974</A>, p. 336) of the 
Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test and the lack of scale invariance of both the Hodges-Lehmann point estimator and Moses confidence 
interval would be valuable here.  And it is useful to point out that the Moses confidence interval will not necessarily be 
symmetric about the Hodges-Lehmann point estimate. </P>  <P> <A HREF="v12n1/datasets.bradstreet.html#table3">Table 3</A>

the normal theory analyses of the absence of a clinically meaningful drug interaction on log EE AUC, log EE Cmax, and log 
NET AUC, are also suggested by the distribution-free analyses.  Again it is clear that log EE AUC is elevated 
(<I>p</I> < .0001) to some degree when Drug D is given.  The evidence that log EE Cmax is elevated (<I>p</I> = .15) is 
less impressive, as the lower limit of the 90% confidence interval, 0.99, is now just below 1.0.  This difference between 
the normal theory and distribution-free analysis may simply be attributable to the modest degree of nonnormality shown in 
the normal probability plot for log EE Cmax  (<A HREF="v12n1/datasets.bradstreet.html#figure10">Figure 10b</A>).  The 
period effect for log NET AUC is confirmed again (<I>p</I> = .0002).   </P>  <P> The most notable difference between the 
distribution-free and normal theory analyses is observed for log NET Cmax, where Subject 9 is a rather extreme outlier.  
The point estimate for the true ratio is now greater, 0.90 vs. 0.86, and the confidence interval, (0.82, 0.96), is now 
somewhat shorter (length = 0.14 as compared to length = 0.17 for the normal theory analysis) and it is contained completely 
within the target bioequivalence interval of [0.80, 1.25].  So, the original conclusion  of a clinically meaningful 
reduction in log NET Cmax arrived at through the normal theory analysis is now reversed based upon the distribution-free 
analysis to a conclusion of no clinically important interaction.  However, it is still clear that log NET Cmax is reduced 
(<I>p</I> = .0032) to some degree when Drug D is given concomitantly as the upper confidence limit, 0.96, is still below 
1.0.  And one must wonder, what proportion of the population does Subject 9 represent? </P>
