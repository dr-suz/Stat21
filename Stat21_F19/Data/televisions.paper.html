<H2>Abstract</H2>

       
<P>  This dataset contains information on life          expectancies in
various countries of the world and          the densities of people per
television set and of          people per physician in those countries. 
The          example has proven very useful for helping students        
 to discover the fundamental principle that          correlation does
not imply causation.  The data          also give students an
opportunity to explore data          transformations and to consider
whether a causal          connection is necessary for one variable to be
a          useful predictor of another.

<H1>    1.  Introduction
</H1>

<P>1    One of the most important principles for introductory     
statistics students to grasp is that a strong association      between
two variables does not necessarily imply a      cause-and-effect
relationship between them.  This dataset,      taken from <A HREF="#World Almanac"
><CITE>The World Almanac and Book of Facts 1993</CITE></A>, helps     
students to discover this idea for themselves.  For each of      the 40
countries in the world with populations of more than      20 million as
of 1990, the dataset records the life      expectancy at birth, the
number of people per television      set, and the number of people per
physician.  Life      expectancies are also provided for males and
females      separately, with the average of those two figures used as  
   the country's overall life expectancy.
</P>
<P>2    I use this dataset in an introductory course where students    
 work through activities designed to help them discover      statistical
concepts and explore statistical techniques for      themselves.  The
course is taught in a microcomputer-      equipped classroom in which
two students sit at each      machine.  The students work
collaboratively with their      partners and use the technology to
facilitate the      calculation of summary statistics and the production
of      graphical displays.  Each student records his/her responses     
to the activities' questions in an "activity guide" which      serves as
a structured journal for the student.  The course      and its
pedagogical approach are described in <A HREF="#Rossman">Rossman     
(1992)</A>.
</P>


               
<H1>2.  Association, Correlation, Causation</H1>

<P>3    I begin by asking students (in their activity guides) to     
make guesses about life expectancies in various countries; I      then
ask them to guess the number of people per television      set in these
countries.  Since this variable is a somewhat      unusual one, it
forces them to stop and reflect.  I also ask      students to form a
conjecture as to whether any relationship      exists between a
country's life expectancy and its density      of people per television
set and, if so, whether the      association is positive or negative. 
Asking for these      "guesses" often produces lively debate among the
students.      I believe that it also helps them to think about data not
as      naked numbers but as numbers with specific contexts.  Each     
student records his/her guesses for future reference.
</P>
<P>4    I then present the students with the actual data and have     
them comment on how well they have guessed.  I ask them to      identify
the countries with the highest (Japan) and lowest      (Ethiopia) life
expectancies as well as those with the      highest (Myanmar) and lowest
(United States) ratios of      people to television sets.  Even though
the issue at hand      concerns the relationship between the variables,
I first ask      them to examine and comment on the distributions of
each      variable separately.
</P>
<P>5    Students then use the computer to produce a scatterplot of     
life expectancy vs. people per television and comment on the     
obvious negative association between these variables.  They      also
use the computer to calculate the value of the      correlation
coefficient (-0.606).  In the absence of a      computer-equipped
classroom, the instructor could use an      overhead projection device
to display the scatterplot and      correlation or supply students with
handouts.  Since the      dataset contains only forty countries,
students could even      construct the scatterplot by hand.
</P>
<P>6    Having discovered the negative association between life     
expectancy and people per television, students then grapple      with
the issue of causation.  I ask them if sending      shiploads of
televisions to countries with short life      expectancies would cause
their inhabitants to live longer.      Most students find the question
laughable, so I follow up by      asking them to suggest a more
plausible explanation for the      association between life expectancy
and people per      television.  Finally, I ask students to write a
conclusion      about whether correlation implies causation.  The vast  
   majority of students succeed in discovering this crucial     
distinction between correlation and causation for      themselves.
</P>


           
<H1>  3.  Regression, Transformation, Prediction
</H1>

<P>7    Despite the lack of a cause-and-effect relationship between    
 the variables, one can still ask whether the number of      people per
television set in a country is a useful predictor      of that country's
life expectancy.  I like to complicate the      issue by asking students
which variable they would prefer to      use as a predictor of life
expectancy:  number of people per      television set or number of
people per physician.  Since the      number of people per physician
seems to be more directly      related to life expectancy, most students
choose that      variable.
</P>
<P>8    Upon analyzing scatterplots, students find that the     
association between life expectancy and people per physician      is
very similar to that between life expectancy and people      per
television.  The correlation between life expectancy and      people per
physician (-0.666) is comparable to that between       life expectancy
and people per television (-0.606).        In neither case is the
association linear, however, so I ask       students to consider
transformations of the data.
</P>
<P>9    It turns out that logarithmic transformations of people per    
 television and of people per physician make the      relationships with
life expectancy fairly linear.  The data      suggest that people per
television is a more useful      predictor of life expectancy than is
people per physician,      even though the latter variable seems to be
much more      directly related to the response variable.  The values of
     r-squared and mean square error turn out to be .731 and 4.10     
for the model predicting life expectancy from the log of      people per
television, compared to .693 and 4.63 for the      model predicting life
expectancy from the log of people per      physician.  Analysis of
residuals reveals no striking      violations of the normal assumptions
for either regression      model.</P>



                        
<H1>  4.  Other Questions
</H1>

<P>10    Students can also pursue other interesting questions raised   
   by these data.  They might explore outliers and their       effects
on the associations.  Another issue might involve        asking whether
the people per television variable is better        at predicting a
country's male or female life expectancy.         One can also examine
differences among the continents or        some other classification of
the countries in terms of the        strength of this relationship.
</P>


                           
<H1> 5.  Conclusion
</H1>

<P>11    I have found this dataset to be extremely effective for      
leading students to discover some important ideas related to      
correlation, causation, and prediction.  The variables are      
interesting and easily understood by students, who often       engage in
spirited discussions about their findings.
