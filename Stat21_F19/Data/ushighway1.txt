NAME: US INTERSTATE SYSTEM I
TYPE: Census
SIZE: 99 observations , 5 variables (3 numeric, 2 character)

DESCRIPTIVE ABSTRACT:
This dataset consists of a listing of all US interstate
highways, treating the highway as the sampling unit.

SOURCE:
Rand McNally - 1993 Business Traveler's Road Atlas and Guide
to Major Cities.

VARIABLE DESCRIPTIONS:
Interstate #            Columns 1-2
Number of states        Columns 4-5
Approximate miles       Columns 7-10
Southern or Western end Columns 12-34
Northern or Eastern end Columns 36-57

SPECIAL NOTES:
The miles are approximate, as author read them off maps using
guide markers provided along highways.

STORY BEHIND THE DATA:
Author, who is very interested in maps, geography, and U.S.
transportation system had a lot of free time one weekend. He
knew of no source that provided such information. Other datasets
were also created at the same time.

PEDAGOGICAL NOTES:
While this data may be more suited for cocktail parties than
the classroom, it does allow a teacher to use some actual data
when teaching concepts of descriptive statistics, such as graphical
and numeric descriptions of a set of measurements. After having
taught many classes and using the terms 'suppose we have the following
measurements ...', the author vowed to get more interesting data.
