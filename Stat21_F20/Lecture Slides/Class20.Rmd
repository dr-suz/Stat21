  - Make sure you review the solutions to the [Class 17 worksheet](http://www.swarthmore.edu/NatSci/sthornt1/Stat021/Class17_files/Class17Worksheet.pdf)
  
- Check-in 

- Recorded practice with MLR 

  - Independent data 

  - Example(s) from textbook  

  - Open questions

## Morning check in  
### 7 mins

.pull-left[**Instructions:**

- **Everyone**, use the "annotate" feature to put an "X" near the word(s) that most accurately describe how you are feeling this morning. 
- **Note-taker**, open this slide on your internet browser and share your screen with your group. 
- **Presenter**, take a screenshot of the page when everyone is finished marking their "X"'s and send it to me via your group's slack channel. I will verify that I have seen the image with a check mark on your Slack comment.
- **Recorder**, take notes on who is in attendance and who is performing each role for today's discussions.
- **Questioner**, make sure that everyone has a chance to check in and discuss how they are feeling today.]

## Practice with MLR
### Problem 3.17 

Consider the patient satisfaction data in Table B.17. For the purposes of this exercise, ignore the regressor “Medical-Surgical.” Perform a thorough analysis of these data. Please discuss any differences from the analyses outlined in Sections 2.7 and 3.6.

```{r}
library('tidyverse')
patient_satisfaction <- read_table2(url("http://www.swarthmore.edu/NatSci/sthornt1/DataFiles/patient_satisfaction.txt")) %>% select(-X6)
head(patient_satisfaction)
```

## Practice with MLR 
### Problem 3.13 

An engineer studied the effect of four variables on a dimensionless factor used to describe pressure drops in a screen-plate bubble column. Table B.9 summarizes the experimental results. 

```{r}
library('tidyverse')
pressure_drop <- read_table2(url("http://www.swarthmore.edu/NatSci/sthornt1/DataFiles/pressure_drop.txt")) 
head(pressure_drop)
```

## Practice Problems 

Use the following code to install R package "MPV" that has most of the data sets from Appendix B of your textbook. 
```{r} 
packageurl <- "https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/contrib/4.0/MPV_1.55.tgz"
install.packages(packageurl, repos=NULL, type="source")
library('MPV')
```

Here is a list of suggested practice problems from your textbook (which is available online through the Tripod library service). I recommend that you work through these examples to prepare for the final test. 
  - Chapter 3 (3.5, 3.7, 3.13)  
  - Chapter 4 (4.4, 4.22, 4.27)
  - Chapter 5 (5.2, 5.6, 5.20) 
  - Chapter 7 (7.2, 7.3) 
  - Chapter 8 (8.3, 8.6, 8.17)
