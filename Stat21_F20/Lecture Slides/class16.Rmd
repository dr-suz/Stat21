## Morning check in  
### 7 mins

.pull-left[**Instructions:**

- **Everyone**, use the "annotate" feature to put an "X" near the word(s) that most accurately describe how you are feeling this morning. 
- **Note-taker**, open this slide on your internet browser and share your screen with your group. 
- **Presenter**, take a screenshot of the page when everyone is finished marking their "X"'s and send it to me via your group's slack channel. I will verify that I have seen the image with a check mark on your Slack comment.
- **Recorder**, take notes on who is in attendance and who is performing each role for today's discussions.
- **Questioner**, make sure that everyone has a chance to check in and discuss how they are feeling today.]

## SLR - Transforming data 
### Group work  

Complete Step 3 of the [worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BO_59xZriB8RJS43B6kOCMfHn3cOgn_lA5uBmuqg6os/edit?usp=sharing) from last class. As before, you may find it useful to review some properties of logarithms and exponents using this [reference](https://wou.edu/mathcenter/files/2015/09/Exponents-and-Logarithms.pdf). 

**Note-taker:** You will submit the completed worksheet to me over your group's Slack channel at the end of class. (Please make sure the settings allow me to access your document!) 

**Presenter:** Be prepared to answer questions based on your worksheet when we discuss the worksheet as a class. 

**Recorder:** Keep track of the time and alert your group when you have 5 mins remaining. 

**Questioner:** Be prepared to ask any questions that have come up within your group discussion when I stop by your breakout room.

## SLR - Transforming data 
### Group work  

We are going to practice transforming the data to fit a stronger linear model to the SAT score data from Problem 3 of Test 1. 

**Step 1**

1. Use the code on the next two slides to write out the estimated regression equation for the data and interpret the meaning of the slope. 
2. What important features do you notice in the scatter plot of the data, the residual plot, and/or the normal probability plot for the standardized residuals?

```{r eval=FALSE}
income_SAT2 <- tibble(income = c(10000, 30000, 50000, 70000, 90000, 110000,
                                 130000, 150000, 180000, 300000),
                      SAT_score = c(1323, 1398, 1461, 1503, 1545, 1580, 1594,
                                     1619, 1636, 1721))
SLR_SAT <- lm(SAT_score ~ income, income_SAT2)
summary(SLR_SAT)
```

### Step 1 continued


```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(income_SAT2, aes(x=income ,y=SAT_score)) +
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title="SAT data scatter plot", x="Household income", y="SAT Score")

income_SAT2 <- income_SAT2 %>% mutate(resids = SLR_SAT$residuals,
                                      fits = SLR_SAT$fitted.values)
ggplot(income_SAT2, aes(sample=SAT_score)) +
  stat_qq() + 
  stat_qq_line() + 
  labs(title="Normal prob plot for residuals")

ggplot(income_SAT2, aes(x=fits, y=resids)) +
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title="Residuals vs fitted values", x="Fitted values", y="Residuals") +
  geom_hline(yintercept=0)
```

**Step 2**

1. Use the `mutate` function to transform the response variable $Y$ by raising `SAT_score` to the 10th power. I.e. create a new response variable $Y_{transformed} = Y^{10}$. Then fit a SLR model using $x$ to predict $Y_{transformed}$.  
2. Produce and interpret a scatter plot of the data, a residual plot, and a normal probability plot for the residuals.
3. Write out the estimated regression equation for the transformed data and then interpret the slope of this model and in the context of the original units of $Y$. 


```{r eval=FALSE}
# Here is how to find a logarithm of base 10 in R
a <- 22000
b <- log(a, base=10)
10^b  # Double check the properties of logarithms 
```

### Group work 

**Step 3** (Reference the Class 14 Part 3 lecture notes for the code.) 

1. Use the regression model from Step 2 to compute a confidence interval for the mean SAT score for a student from a household making $62,000 per year. Interpret this interval in the units of the un-transformed data.   
2. Use the regression model from Step 2 to compute a prediction interval for the SAT score of a student from a household making $120,000 per year. Interpret this interval in the units of the un-transformed data.   


```{r echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
**Step 3**

1. Use the `mutate` function to transform the predictor variable `income` by taking the logarithm. I.e. create a new predictor variable $x_{transformed} = log(x)$. Then fit a SLR model using $x_{transformed}$ to predict $Y$.   
2. Produce and interpret a scatter plot of the data, a residual plot, and a normal probability plot for the standardized residuals.
3. Write out the estimated regression equation for the transformed data and  interpret the slope. 


For future classes/comprehension quizzes: In each of the following situations, determine which is more appropriate: a confidence interval for the mean response or a prediction interval for an unobserved response. 
```

## Simulation Study
### Prediction intervals and confidence intervals for the slope 

This is Problem 2.23 in our textbook.

Consider the simple linear regression model 
$$y = 50 + 10x + \epsilon, \quad \text{where } \epsilon \sim N(0,16).$$
Generate 500 samples of 20 observations drawing one observation for each level of $x=1,1.5,, \dots,10$ for each sample. 

(a) For each sample compute the least-squares estimates of the slope and intercept. Construct histograms of the sample values of $\hat{\beta}_0$ and $\hat{\beta}_1$. Discuss the shape of these histograms. 

(b) For each sample, compute an estimate of $E[Y \mid x=5]$. Construct a histogram of the estimates you obtained. Discuss the shape of the histogram 

(c) For each sample, compute a $95\%$ CI on the slope. How many of these intervals contain the true value $\beta_1=10$? Is this what you would expect?

(d) For each estimate of $E[Y \mid x=5]$ in part (b), compute the $95\%$ CI. How many of these intervals contain the true value of $E[Y \mid x=5]=100$? Is this what you would expect?

## Simulation Study
### Group Work

Download the R script file called `class16_simulations.R`, available [here](http://www.swarthmore.edu/NatSci/sthornt1/Stat021/Class16_files/class16_simulation.R). 

**Note-taker:** You will submit the completed R script file to me over your group's Slack channel at the end of class. You will need to upload this file as an attachment in a Slack message. 

**Presenter:** Be prepared to answer the discussion questions when we discuss the prompts as a class and/or be prepared to mention any questions that arose during your groups discussion. 

**Recorder:** Keep track of the time and alert your group when you have 5 mins remaining. 

**Questioner:** Make sure that everyone understands the general purpose of each coding section for parts (a) - (d) by asking clarifying questions. Also, be prepared to ask any questions that have come up within your group discussion when I stop by your breakout room.
