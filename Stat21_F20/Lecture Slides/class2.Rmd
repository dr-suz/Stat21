- Housekeeping items

- Knitting Homework Documents with R Markdown 

- Simulation study of the Central Limit Theorem 

  - Practice with sharing screen 
  
  - Practice with Zoom whiteboard

# Some housekeeping 


### Diverse Statisticians Matter!

If you are planning to attend the lunch on Monday, the 14th at 1:10pm with Dr. Emma Benn please send me a message on Slack! (We want to make sure that at least a few students show up.)

**Fun fact** Dr. Benn is actually a Swat alumnus! 

### Math/Stats Department Social Event

# Continuing from last class...

## Introduction to RStudio

- Compile R script document 

- Knit R Markdown document 

  - Run lines of code within 
  
  - Create HTML and PDF outputs


**Update:** We have a different shared RStudio address: /shared/stat021f20
(The change is reflected in the syllabus online.)

***

Make sure you have access to all of the following Slack channels:

1. homework-q-and-a
2. r-q-and-a
3. typo-alert
4. weekly-checkin
5. Your group specific channel

# Group Roles 


  - Note-taker - this is the person creating the presentation item on the Zoom whiteboard or separate document etc. 

  - Presenter - this is the person who will report the presentation materials and general discussion.

  - Recorder - this is the person who takes notes on who is in attendance, who is participating, and keeps track of the time.

  - Questioner - this person will push back when the group comes to consensus too quickly, without considering a number of options or points of view.

# Simulation Study 

**To do:** 

Open the CLT simulations R script file in Rstudio.swarthmore.edu. (Only one group member needs to do this and can share their screen). Answer the questions presented within the R comments (the #'s) at the end of the file. 


**Hand in:** 

In the Zoom chat, submit a text document with your group's written answers. 


When we come back together as a class, be prepared to discuss what you observed in the simulations with your group.

# Simulation Study 
## Questions about the CLT 

**From Moodle:** 

- How can a variable that only takes on values from $[-2,3]$ have a mean that has a distribution ranging from negative infinity to infinity?* 


Any others? 


.footnote[*A good (albeit math-heavy) answer to this question can be found in the comments here: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/339759/how-can-the-central-limit-theorem-hold-for-distributions-which-have-limits-on-th. The comment that begins with "This is an excellent question..."]

## Questions about inference for a proportion 

**From Moodle:** 

- I'd like to go over confidence intervals and hypothesis tests in class if possible.

- What is the difference between $p$ and $\hat{p}$? 

- What is the critical value? 

- Can we go over why we use $p_0$ in the formula for the Z-score test statistic? 


**Assignment**

For the group Questioner: Make sure all of the above questions are addressed during your group's discussions for Practice problem 1. 

For the group Presenter: Be ready to report your group's responses to any of the questions above. You'll either report your group's solution to these questions (when asked) or you'll report a more refined version of these questions based on your discussion (or both). If you don't have any answers to report but only have more questions, that is ok! Report those.

# Practice Problem 1
## Inference for a proportion

In New York City on October 23rd, 2014, a doctor who had recently been treating Ebola patients in Guinea went to the hospital with a slight fever and was subsequently diagnosed with Ebola. Soon after, a survey conducted by the Marist Poll, an organization with a carefully designed methodology for drawing random samples from identified populations, found that, out of a sample of size $1042$, $82\%$ of New Yorkers favored a "mandatory 21-day quarantine for anyone who has come in contact with an Ebola patient."


**To do:** 

a) Verify that the sampling distribution of $\hat{p}$ is nearly normal.

b) Construct a $95\%$ confidence interval for $p$, the proportion of New York adults who supported a quarantine for anyone who has come into contact with an Ebola patient. Specifically state the values of $\hat{p}_{obs}$, $z_{\alpha/2}^*$, and $SE(\hat{p})$.  

c) Conduct an $\alpha=0.05$ hypothesis test to answer the question: Is the proportion of New York adults who support the mandatory quarantine larger than $75\%$? 


**Hand in:** 
Screenshot of your group's Zoom whiteboard with your answers to the questions above.
