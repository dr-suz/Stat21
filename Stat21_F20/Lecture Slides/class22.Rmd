## Morning check in  
### 5 mins

.pull-left[**Instructions:** Use the "annotate" feature to put an "X" near the word(s) that most accurately describe how you are feeling this morning. 

- **Note-taker**, open this slide on your internet browser and share your screen with your group. 
- **Presenter**, take a screenshot of the page when everyone is finished marking their "X"'s and send it to me via your group's slack channel. I will verify that I have seen the image with a check mark on your Slack comment.
- **Recorder**, take notes on who is in attendance and who is performing each role for today's discussions.
- **Questioner**, make sure that everyone has a chance to check in and discuss how they are feeling today.]

## Upcoming Event 


.center["Women in Statistics: We've Come so Far?"

Leslie A. McClure, PhD

Professor, Chair

Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics] 


.center[**Wednesday**, December 9, 2020

2:30 pm â€“ 3:30 pm EDT]


The term leaky pipeline has been used to describe the disappearance of women from STEM fields, and the field of statistics is no exception. In this talk, I will describe the leaky pipeline in statistics and biostatistics, discuss some of the reasons why women leave STEM fields, and discuss strategies for helping to plug the leaky pipeline.
