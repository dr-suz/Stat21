This test is due on to be submitted on Gradescope on __October 17__ by __12:00pm ET__. Please use the `#test1_questions` channel on Slack to post any clairfication questions. Do not ask questions like "Is [this] the right answer?" 


You must submit your solutions as a single __PDF__ document uploaded to __Gradescope__. You may use R markdown to write up your solutions alone or you may use R markdown and hand-written solutions. You must show all of your work, including code input and output. Please make sure each problem is __clearly labeled__ and that any handwritten components (such as pictures or equations) are easily readable in the PDF document. You may want to use a service like CamScanner (https://www.camscanner.com/) to help you upload handwritten pages and Small PDF (https://smallpdf.com/merge-pdf) to merge multiple PDFs into a single document. 

You are permitted to reference all class material and use the internet (though I am not sure it will be very helpful). You are not permitted however, to get assistance from any person online or otherwise.


+ Your file should contain the code to answer each question in its own code block. Your code should produce plots/output that will be automatically embedded in the output pdf file.
+ Each answer must be supported by written statements and relevant plots.
+ Each problem is worth 20 points for a total of 100 points possible. 
+ In order to knit this document, make sure you have installed the following packages in your version of RStudio: `ggplot2`, `tidyverse`, `gridExtra`, `gcookbook`, `knitr`

The table below is from an article titled "Class in America-2012" by Gregory Mantsios. This table shows the median combined SAT scores (ranging from 400 to 1600) and the household income (broken into 10 categories) of 1,647,123 SAT-takers in the year 2010. 

| Income | Median SAT Score |
|--------|------------------|
| < \$20,000 | 1323  |
| \$20,000 - \$40,000 |  1398 |
| \$40,000 - \$60,000 |  1461 |
| \$60,000 - \$80,000 |  1503 |
| \$80,000 - \$100,000 |  1545 |
| \$100,000 - \$120,000 | 1580  |
| \$120,000 - \$140,000 | 1594  |
| \$140,000 - \$160,000 | 1619  |
| \$160,000 - \$200,000 | 1636  |
| $\geq$ \$200,000 | 1721  |


Based on this table, we may suspect that there is a relationship between SAT score and household income. Run the following lines of R code to import a data set consisting of a simple random sample of 100 students who took the SAT in 2010. (This sample was based on the data report by the College Board, feel free to talk to me about how I obtained this sample later![^1]) Use this data set to answer Problems 1-2. 

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
SAT_data <- read_table2(url("http://www.swarthmore.edu/NatSci/sthornt1/DataFiles/SAT_data2.txt"))
```


## Problem 1

State the null and alternative hypotheses for an ANOVA test of association between income and SAT scores. Comment on whether or not the necessary assumptions seem reasonable. Then perform the ANOVA test and interpret the results in the context of this data set. 




## Problem 2

Perform a Tukey HSD pairwise comparison to determine where the greatest disparities in SAT scores occur.

## Problem 3

Suppose we decide to treat household income as a quantitative variable and [interpolate](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/interpolate) the annual income in the following manner. 


| Income | Median SAT Score |
|--------|------------------|
| 10,000 | 1323  |
| 30,000 |  1398 |
| 50,000 |  1461 |
| 70,000 |  1503 |
| 90,000 |  1545 |
| 110,000 | 1580  |
| 130,000 | 1594  |
| 150,000 | 1619  |
| 180,000 | 1636  |
| 300,000 | 1721  |

Fit a SLR model to this data with the median SAT score as the response variable. Write out the estimated regression equation and interpret the slope in the context of the problem. Do you think a SLR is a reasonable model for this data? Justify your answer. 



**Hint:** You may copy and paste the code below to create a data object in R based on the table above. 
```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
income_SAT2 <- tibble(income = c(10000, 30000, 50000, 70000, 90000, 110000,
                                 130000, 150000, 180000, 300000),
                      median_SAT = c(1323, 1398, 1461, 1503, 1545, 1580, 1594,
                                     1619, 1636, 1721))

```

## Problem 4

The data above was published by the US Census bureau Current Population Report in September 2020 on income and poverty in the United States.[^2] In this data, income is broken into 9 different categories and the number of households (in thousands) within each income bracket is recorded for the year 2019. (E.g. In the table above, there were $10276.08 \times 1000$ households who reported an annual income between \$15,000 and \$24,999 in the 2019 census.) If income inequality is not a real issue in the US, then we would expect to see the total number of households is uniformly distributed across these different income brackets. 

Determine which chi-square procedure to use to statistically determine if income inequality is present in the US. Explicitly write out your null and alternative hypotheses, comment on the validity of the required assumptions, and interpret the results of the test at an $\alpha=0.05$ significance level. Show all of your work including R code and output. 


**Hint:** You may copy and paste the code below to create a data object in R based on the table above. Also, recall that you can extract a column (say, `households`) from a data object (say, `household_income`) by coding `household_income$households`. 


```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
household_income <- tibble(
  income_bracket = factor(c("<15,000", "15,000-24,999", "25,000-34,999",
                            "35,000-49,999", "50,000-74,999", "75,000-99,999",
                            "100,000-149,999", "150,000-199,999", ">=200,000")),
  households = c(11689.041, 10276.08, 10661.433, 15028.767, 21194.415, 15799.473, 
                 19909.905, 10661.433, 13230.453))

kbl(xtabs(households ~ income_bracket + race,household_income_race), booktabs=TRUE)
```

## Problem 5

The data above is based on the same data from Problem 5. This data set however identifies not only the annual income of each household in the US in 2019 but also identifies the race of the household. Though the US census now allows households to select more than one racial identifier, we are going to consider only non-intersecting racial categories: white alone (not Hispanic), Black alone, and Asian alone. Based on the data above, perform a statistical test to determine if race and income bracket are independent variables. Explicitly write out your null and alternative hypotheses, comment on the validity of the required assumptions, and interpret the results of the test at an $\alpha=0.05$ significance level. Show all of your work including R code and output. 



**Hint:** You may copy and paste the code below to create a data object in R based on the table above. 

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
income_race_table <- matrix(c(444.990,  2933.288,  6195.364,
         342.300,  1961.210,  6195.364,
         355.992,  1944.156,  6365.100,
