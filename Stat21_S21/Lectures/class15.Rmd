# Agenda

Here's the agenda for today's class: 

- Group check-ins (7 mins)

- Final project part 1 instructions (5 mins)

- Syllabus update (3 mins) 

- Appropriateness of the linear model (10 mins)

- Homework 6 group work

  * Problem 3 
  
  * Problem 4 

- Housekeeping items and announcements (5 mins)

# Tuesday check-in 

- Please welcome any new group members! 

- Determine a new rotation schedule for the different group roles if applicable. 

- Send me a screenshot of your check-in markers on Slack

- [Fill out the group roles for today's class](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d34JxqXQON6MyIEjN5ugkByCeTuGTTb_ovvPfSAca_g/edit?usp=sharing)

## Determining the appropriateness of the linear model 

- Coefficient of determination 

- ANOVA F-test for the significance of the regression model 

- Residuals plot 

For SLR models specifically, this is equivalent to considering 

- The correlation between $x$ and $y_{obs}$

- The t-test for the significance of the predictor $x$ 

- A scatter plot of $x$ and $y_{obs}$

What can be done if the linear model does not seem to fit? 

---
## Homework 6 
### Problem 3 - group work 

**Instructions:** Work with your group to create residual plots that show each of the following using the Zoom whiteboard:  
  
  - constant variance and linearity; 
  
  - non-constant variance and linearity; 
  
  - constant variance and non-linearity;
  
  - non-constant variance and non-linearity. 

---
## Homework 6 
### Problem 3 - group work 

**Group roles:**

- Recorder - Share a Zoom whiteboard screen with your group mates and verify that each group member can annotate on the whiteboard. Send screenshots of each of the plots to me on Slack as you complete them. 

- Reporter - Keep track of your group's progress on the group progress check-in spreadsheet and be prepared to draw example plots on the Zoom whiteboard for the class discussion after this activity. 

- Questioner - Do your thing and ask questions!

## Homework 6 
### Problem 4 - group work 


The number of pounds of steam used per month at a plant is thought to be related to the average monthly ambient temperature. The past yearâ€™s usages (per 1000 lbs) and temperatures follow.

```{r}
steam_data <- tibble(
  month = c("Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"), 
  temperature = c(21,24,32,47,50,59,68,74,62,50,41,30),
  usage = c(185.79,214.47,288.03,424.84,454.68,539.03,621.55,675.06,562.03,452.93,369.95,273.98))
```

**Instructions:** Work with your group to perform the following analyses. 

(a) Fit a simple linear regression model to the data. 

(b) Test for significance of regression. 

(c) Plant management believes that an increase in average ambient temperature of 1 degree will increase average monthly steam consumption by 10,000  lb. Do the data support this statement? 

(d) Construct a 99% prediction interval on steam usage in a month with average ambient temperature of 58 degrees.

## Homework 6 
### Problem 4 - group work 

**Group roles:**

- Recorder - Copy and paste the code above into RStudio and share your screen with your group mates. You are responsable for typing and running the code. Share a screenshot of your code with me when there is 1 minute remaining.

- Reporter - Keep track of your group's progress on the group progress check-in spreadsheet and be prepared to discuss your group's answers (or any additional questions) with the class.  

- Questioner - Ask questions as your group comes up with solutions to the problems above and make sure you understand the justification for part (c). In what circumstances would we want a prediction interval vs a confidence interval for the mean response (in part d)?

### Planning ahead for next class  

.scroll-output[
- Complete the comprehension quiz for week 9 by Thursday morning. (This will be available by tonight.)

- Final project Part 1 is due April 15th to **Moodle** (not Gradescope)

- Next class, we'll continue to practice with SLR models from HW 6 

  * Problems 6-7 
  
  * Problem 8-9 (time permitting)
