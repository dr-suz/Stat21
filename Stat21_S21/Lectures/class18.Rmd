## Simulation Study
### Confidence intervals for SLR models 

$$y = 50 + 10x + \epsilon, \quad \text{where } \epsilon \sim N(0,16)$$


Generate 500 samples of 20 observations drawing one observation for each level of $x=1,1.5,2, \dots,10$ for each sample. 

**Part 1:** For each sample compute the least-squares estimates of the slope and intercept.

**Part 2:** For each sample, compute an estimate of $E[Y \mid x=5]$. 

**Part 3:** For each sample, compute a $95\%$ CI on the slope, $\beta_1$

**Part 4:** For each estimate of $E[Y \mid x=5]$ in part 2, compute the $95\%$ CI for the mean response

Here is a [link](http://www.swarthmore.edu/NatSci/sthornt1/Stat021/S2021/simulation_study.R) to the R code for this simulation exercise. Note that this is an R script file, not an R Markdown file.

### Planning ahead for next week  

.scroll-output[
- Submit Test 2 to Gradescope by noon on Saturday

  * I will be on Slack today from 2-3pm EST and tomorrow from 6-7pm EST
  
  * I am not holding video office hours today 

- Watch the videos for Week 11 before Tuesday's class.  

  * Introduce multiple linear regression (MLR)

  * Sampling distributions for estimates from SLR models 

- Take the comprehension quiz for Week 10 before Tuesday's class.

- Finish and submit Final Project Part 1 by Monday, April 19th at noon EST. 

  * I am meeting with IT today to try to figure out what is causing the "package keyval" error message and I will announce once this has been solved on Slack. 
  
The following will be published on Moodle this weekend so please read through them before class next week 

  * Instructions for Final Project Part 2 

  * Homework 7

### Announcements 

**Math/Stat Department Dresden Memorial Lecture by Professor Sarah Koch** 

Sarah Koch is an Associate Professor of Mathematics at the University of Michigan. Her research combines topology, algebraic geometry, and complex analysis in the field of complex dynamics, at once an ancient field asking basic questions about what happens when you repeat an operation over and over, and at the same time, a very modern one, whose beautiful Julia and Mandelbrot sets are illustrated on many a screensaver today.

**Wednesday, April 21, 8:00-9:00pm** Dresden Lecture

What is the shape of a polynomial? 
We will work with the complex numbers and discuss how one might understand the geometry or "shape" of a given (complex) polynomial function. There will be many pictures and movies in this talk.

**Friday, April 23, 3:00-4:00pm** Dresden Presentation and Q&A

Math Circles: a bundle of outreach
One of my favorite parts of being a mathematician is sharing math with other people. I have been extensively involved in outreach since I arrived at the Michigan Math Department in 2013. I have led Math Circle sessions for middle schoolers, high schoolers, and math teachers. In 2018, I was on my way to Dearborn, Michigan to lead a Math Circle session with one of my colleagues. Something happened during that trip that changed my life. I would love to tell you about it!

**Friday, April 23, 4:10-4:40pm** AWM/W+iMS Virtual Tea with Speaker
