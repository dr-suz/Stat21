# Tuesday check-in 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.height=500}
knitr::include_graphics("Figs/feelings_wheel.jpg")
```


---
# Normal Random Variables: Pictures and Code

- density curve/histograms

- critical value

- quantiles

- probabilities (area under the curves)

- standardization/Z-score



---
# Normal Random Variables: Pictures and Code

```{r}
sample_size <- 10
rnorm(sample_size, mean=3, sd=1.5)
```

---
# Normal Random Variables: Pictures and Code


```{r}
my_quantile <- 3.45
pnorm(my_quantile, mean=3, sd=1.5, lower.tail=TRUE)
```



--
```{r}
my_probability <- 0.75
qnorm(my_probability, mean=3, sd=1.5, lower.tail=TRUE)
```

# CLT Simulation Exercise

**To do:** 

Open the CLT_Example.R file in Moodle. (Only one group member needs to do this and can share their screen). Answer the questions presented within the R comments (the #'s) at the end of the file. 


**Hand in:** 

On Slack, send me a DM with your group's written answers. 

When we come back together as a class, be prepared to discuss what you observed in the simulations with your group. 


**Group roles:**

- Recorder 

- Reporter

- Questioner

# Example
## Inference for a proportion 

In New York City on October 23rd, 2014, a doctor who had recently been treating Ebola patients in Guinea went to the hospital with a slight fever and was subsequently diagnosed with Ebola. Soon after, a survey conducted by the Marist Poll, an organization with a carefully designed methodology for drawing random samples from identified populations, found that, out of a sample of size $1042$, $82\%$ of New Yorkers favored a "mandatory 21-day quarantine for anyone who has come in contact with an Ebola patient."

# Example
## Inference for a proportion 

**To do:** 

a) Verify that the sampling distribution of $\hat{p}$ is nearly normal.

b) Construct a $95\%$ confidence interval for $p$, the proportion of New York adults who supported a quarantine for anyone who has come into contact with an Ebola patient. Specifically state the values of $\hat{p}_{obs}$, $z_{\alpha/2}^*$, and $SE(\hat{p})$.  

c) Conduct an $\alpha=0.05$ hypothesis test to answer the question: Do the majority of New York adults support the mandatory quarantine?

## Housekeeping 

- How to submit assignments on Gradescope 

- Requirements for HW problems graded for completeness 

- Re-grade requests (use for tests mainly)


## Looking ahead 

- Complete Week 2 Comprehension Quiz on Moodle by Thursday morning.  

- Next class, we'll be working on problems from HW 1 together. This is a great time for asking questions!

# Announcements 

[Problem-Solving Skills and Strategies](http://www.swarthmore.edu/NatSci/sthornt1/Stat021/Stat21/S2021/Problem Solving Poster.pdf) 

W+iMS and Swarthmore Problem Solvers are co-sponsoring this workshop on **Thursday, February 18, from 3:45-5:00 pm** (EST). 

Come learn about the Putnam competition, about problem-solving techniques, and about making space for women and nonbinary students in the problem solving world. 

Prof. Whitehead will give a presentation on different problem solving strategies. 

W+iMS will be holding space to discuss why these spaces so often feel exclusive.

# Announcements 

**Swat Data Viz group**

Join us each week to analyze a different data set, meet other Swatties, hone your data visualization skills, and build a portfolio. No experience necessary! 

Never used R before? That's okay! This is a supportive, low-stakes environment and perfect for learning at your own pace. 

We'll kick off this **Tuesday 5-5:30pm** (EST) at [this zoom link](https://swarthmore-dot-yamm-track.appspot.com/Redirect?ukey=1F9-nrOEIi9R2t2TNb2WSBm0Ucelzz0d89CTzSeiVUwY-1096690557&key=YAMMID-99960339&link=https%3A%2F%2Fswarthmore.zoom.us%2Fj%2F81874849257%3Fpwd%3DdzM3R1U5YU4rT2t5ZEk1SVVXVjd5dz09) (Meeting ID: 818 7484 9257,  passcode: dataviz). 

You are also welcome to join us asynchronously throughout the week to ask questions and share work via the [Slack group](https://swarthmore-dot-yamm-track.appspot.com/Redirect?ukey=1F9-nrOEIi9R2t2TNb2WSBm0Ucelzz0d89CTzSeiVUwY-1096690557&key=YAMMID-99960339&link=https%3A%2F%2Fjoin.slack.com%2Ft%2Fswat-data-viz%2Fshared_invite%2Fzt-mci5g4s3-_LpMV2J5mYY0zzn~V5Y8DA). 

Future meeting times will be determined based on a slack poll, so be sure to join the group even if Today's meeting time doesn't work for you! 

The group will also have a blog to share our work publicly at https://swatdataviz.com

Have questions? Feel free to reach out to Professor Amanda Luby on Slack or at aluby1@swarthmore.edu
