## Chi-square Goodness-of-fit 

For this test, we have one categorical variable with $k$ different levels. We are interested in determining the distribution of *counts* of the observations across all of these $k$ levels. 

| Category      | Observations  |
|---------------|---------------|
| Level 1       | 21            |
| Level 2       | 10            | 
| Level 3       | 9             | 
| $\dots$       | $\dots$       | 
| Level $k$     | 16            | 


The cells of a *contingency table* are the elements of the table corresponding to a specific row and column. These cells can hold counts, percentages, or measurements on other variables. 

To determine what qualifies as count data, think "what is being measured"? If the answer is the number of observational units (e.g. individuals, cars, etc), then the data is count/frequency data.

## Chi-square Goodness-of-fit 

For this test, we have one categorical variable with $k$ different levels. We are interested in determining the distribution of *counts* of the observations across all of these $k$ levels. 

| Category      | Observations  |
|---------------|---------------|
| Level 1       | 21            |
| Level 2       | 10            | 
| Level 3       | 9             | 
| $\dots$       | $\dots$       | 
| Level $k$     | 16            | 


The null and alternative hypotheses will always follow the same format:

$$H_0: \text{The observed data follow [the theorized model].}$$

$$H_A: \text{The observed data do not follow [the theorized model].}$$

The difficult part is understanding what is *the theorized model* for each particular problem.

## Chi-square example

During an online workshop in 2020, professor emeritus George Lakey posited that in political movements and activist work there are four key roles that individuals play: 

- the inviter: a person who likes to get to know people and host events and get people to socialize and strategize together; 

- the bridge-builder: a person with all the connections who helps build the network and bring different people together for a common cause; 

- the care-giver: a person who is primarily concerned with making sure others are safe from physical and emotional harm; and 

- the truth-teller: a no-nonsense kind of person who is dedicated to telling it like it is. 

At this workshop, $400$ participants were polled and asked which role they identified with most, 18% said inviter, 22% said bridge-builder, 31% care-giver, and 29% truth teller. Use a Chi-square goodness-of-fit test to determine if all four roles equally represented in the population?

## Chi-square example
### Group work

As a group, 

1. State the null and alternative hypotheses in the context of this problem; 

2. Fill in the table below with the observed and expected cell counts; 

3. Calculate the test statistic by hand with the formula: $T.S. = \sum \frac{(Obs-Exp)^2}{Exp}$;

4. Use the `pchisq(quantile, df = , lower.tail=FALSE)` function in R to find the p-value and state your conclusion.


| Role | Observed | Expected | 
|------|----------|----------|
| Inviter |    |     |
| Bridge-builder |    |     |
| Care-giver |     |     |    |
| Truth-teller |    |    |    |

## Chi-square example
### Group work

Show your work in answering the questions on the previous slide. To make this process run smoothly, you may want to use these guidelines for your different group roles:

  
- Recorder - Share your screen with your group mates and write your answers on the previous slide using your stylus. When there is 1 min remaining, share a screenshot of your answers with me via a DM on Slack. 

- Reporter - Keep track of your group's progress on the Google spreadsheet and be prepared to discuss your group's answers or any unanswered questions with the class.  

- Questioner - Do your thing and ask lots of questions as you work with your group to solve these four questions. 

Note, you can check your answers to problems 3 and 4 by filling in the missing components (the ?'s) of the R code below and uncommenting the lines.  

```{r}
#observed = c(?, ?, ?, ?)      # observed counts
#expected = c(?, ?, ?, ?)      # expected proportions
#chisq.test(x = observed, p = expected)
```

## T-tests and Confidence Intervals 
### For small samples 

Inference for a population mean (or difference in means) we don't necessarily need $n$ to be large as long as we can reasonably assume the following about the distribution of the random variable across the entire population: 

  - The distribution of the population is symmetric and 
  
  - The distribution of the population is uni-modal. 
  
**Question:** How can we determine if these assumptions are reasonable? 


--
Note, we still need to be able to assume that the sample is representative of the population, drawn without bias, and each observation is independent of the others.

## Worksheet from Class 5 
### Group work


Spend a few minutes going over your group's answers to the [worksheet](http://www.swarthmore.edu/NatSci/sthornt1/Stat021/S2021/class5_worksheet.pdf) from last class. Since you've all finished the homework by now you should all have answered these questions. Compare your answers and see if any of you used different methods or had different interpretations of these problems. 


To make this process run smoothly, you may want to use these guidelines for your different group roles:
  
- Recorder - Open the worksheet in your browser and share your screen with your group mates;

- Reporter - Keep track of your group's progress on the Google spreadsheet and be prepared to discuss your group's answers or any unanswered questions with me when I visit;  

- Questioner - Be brave and speak up if your interpretation or method for solving these problems differed from the proposed answers. (For fun, see if you can stump your group mates with a question.)


There is nothing for you to hand in to me after this discussion, but I will be stopping by each of your groups to check in and see if there are any questions.

## Bonus Problem 
### Homework 2

Census data for a certain country shows that 19% of the adult residents are Latinx. Suppose 72 people are called for jury duty and only 9 of them are Latinx. We want to know if this apparent under-representation of Latinx jurors calls into question the fairness of the jury selection system.

a) Clearly define the population we are studying.

b) State the unknown parameter that we are interested in estimating. (Hint: It is a proportion.)

c) What is the sample estimate for the parameter in part (b) based on the observed data? 

d) State a null and alternative hypothesis test we can conduct to answer this question and provide the formula for the test statistic.

e) If the null hypothesis is true, draw a Normal density curve representing the distribution of the sample proportion. Specify the mean and variance of this sampling distribution. Label the observed test statistic and shade the region that corresponds to the p-value for the test in part (d).

## Planning ahead for next class

- Complete Week 4 Comprehension Quiz on Moodle by Thursday morning.  

- Look at the course calendar to make sure you're aware that Test 1 coming up soon. 

- Next class, we'll be discussing

  * probability models, 
  
  * critical statistical questions; and 

  * working on problems from HW 3.

QSIDE is pleased to announce our inaugural Data4Justice Conference, a virtual, all-day event for scholars, activists, policymakers, and allies to explore the ways we can power social justice together. The conference has broadly accessible talks and is designed for a general audience. Want to learn more about how data, research, and activism come together to create change? Join us!


The Math/Stats department has institutional membership with QSIDE which means that any math or stats student at Swarthmore has student membership to the group! The department can sponsor students to attend this conference for free. *If you are interested in this opportunity, send me an email with the subject line "Data4Justice Conference Stat 21". *]
