Suppose a research group is hired to investigate the satisfaction of employees at a large hospital. They decide to build a MLR to predict the turnover rates for different positions ($Y$ measured as the proportion of employees leaving per year) as a linear function of a binary categorical predictor variable indicating whether or not the position has union representation and is part or full time, (levels: unionized part time, unionized full time, non-unionized part time, non-unionized full time) and a numerical predictor variable $x_4$, representing the average salary for each position (in 1000s of US dollars).  

Given a "full" model 
$$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_3 x_3 + \beta_4 x_4 + + \beta_5 x_1 x_4 + \beta_6 x_2 x_4 + \beta_7 x_3 x_4 + \epsilon,$$
where $$x_1 = \begin{cases}1, \text{ if position is unionized and part-time}\\ 0, \text{ otherwise} \end{cases}\\
x_2 = \begin{cases}1, \text{ if position is unionized and full-time}\\ 0, \text{ otherwise} \end{cases}\\
x_3 = \begin{cases}1, \text{ if position is not unionized and full-time}\\ 0, \text{ otherwise} \end{cases}$$
and $x_4$ is the average salary, match the questions below to their corresponding null hypotheses.   



a) Is there statistically discernible evidence of a linear relationship between union representation and part/full time jobs and a position's turnover rate?

b) Given we are only comparing positions that have the same average salary, is there a statistically significant difference in the mean turnover rate for positions that are full-time and non-unionized vs those that are full-time and unionized? 

c) Given we are only comparing positions that are part-time and non-unionized, is there a statistically significant difference in the turnover rate for positions with a higher (by 1000 US dollars) average salary? 

d) Does the change in turnover rate associated with increasing average salary depend on whether or not the position is part or full time and unionized? 

e) Given we are only comparing positions that are full-time and non-unionized, is there a statistically significant difference in the turnover rate for positions with a higher (by 1000 US dollars) average salary?
