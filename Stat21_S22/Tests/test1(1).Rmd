**Instructions:** 

There are seven questions on this exam. The points allotted for each question are given at the end of the problem. Please don't write an entire page response for any of the answers. Rather, answer these questions to the best of your ability with succinct, informative statements or observations. 




**Problem XXX** Suppose that the observational units in a study are patients who entered the emergency room at French Hospital in the previous week.  For each of the following, indicate whether it is a categorical (i.e. qualitative) variable, a numerical (i.e. quantitative) variable, **or** not a variable with regard to these observational units.  


a) How long the patient waits to be seen by a medical professional 
\vspace{1in}

b) Day of the week on which the patient arrives 
\vspace{1in}

c) Average wait time before the patient is seen by a medical professional 
\vspace{1in}

d) Whether or not wait times tend to be longer on weekends than weekdays 
\vspace{1in}
 

**Problem 2** Consider the transactions at the Science Center coffee bar to be the observational units in a statistical study. In a paragraph of less, state a research question that involves two quantitative variables for these observational units. Also clearly support and identify the roles of each variable in the study (predictor or response).

**Problem 3** Suppose a professor has a paper titled: *Estimation and hypothesis testing in regression in the presence of nonhomogeneous error variances* lying out on her desk.<sup>[1]</sup> In 1-2 sentences, explain what you think this paper is about? (10 points)
\vspace{3in}


**Problem 4** Based on the data shown in the scatter plot of this comic<sup>[2]</sup>, what can you tell me about the relationship between the $SS_{Mod}$ and $SSE$ terms?
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='60%', fig.align='center'}
#knitr::include_graphics("Figs/linear_regression_joke1.png")
```
\newpage

**Problem 5** Suppose we have observed a small data set (say $n=5$) without any significant measurement error (e.g. we are collecting data on vapor pressure and temperature but our instruments to measure each are exact). How do we find the line of best fit?  
\vspace{2in}


**Problem 6** The data below represents a simple random sample of Singaporean diamonds. Suppose we are interested in how the size of the diamond (in carats) can predict (or explain) what the cost of the diamond will be. Below is the R code for fitting this simple linear regression model.  
```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#diamond_dat <- read_table2("~/Google Drive Swat/Swat docs/Stat 21/Data/diamond_dat.txt",skip=2, col_names = FALSE)
#colnames(diamond_dat) <- c("size", "price")
```

```{r diamondPlots1, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.height=300}
#diamond_mod <- lm(price~size, data=diamond_dat)
#diamond_mod %>% summary
```

Analyse the following three plots based on this regression model to answer the next two questions. 


```{r diamondPlots2, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
##ggplot(diamond_dat, aes(x=size, y=price)) +
##  geom_point() + 
##  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se=FALSE) +
##  labs(title="Simple Linear Reguression", subtitle="Diamond size as a predictor of diamond price",
##       x="Size \n (carats)", y="Price \n (Singapore dollars") 

#ggplot() + 
#  aes(sample=diamond_mod_summary$residuals) + 
#  geom_qq() + 
#  geom_qq_line() +
#  labs(title = "Residual plot", subtitle="Normal probability plot", x="Theoretical", y="Residuals")

#ggplot() + 
#  aes(x=diamond_mod$fitted.values, y=diamond_mod_summary$residuals) +  
#  geom_point() + 
#  labs(title = "Residual plot", subtitle="Fitting diamond prices as a linear function of size", x="Predicted price", y="Residuals") 

```


a) Based on these plots, what conclusions can we make about the presence of a linear relationship, if the random errors are constant, and if the random errors are Normally distributed?
\vspace{2in}


b) Say instead of the size of the diamond measured in carats, we'd like to look at the size in grams (1 carat $=$ 0.2 grams). Would we expect the behavior of any of the plots above to change? Briefly explain your answer. 
\newpage

**Problem 7** The data that appear in the data set "Four-Mile-Run-data.txt" were collected by a GPS watch worn by the runner of a four-mile course. Using heart rate measurements after each run, an analysis of the runner's post-exercise heart rate recovery provides an indication of cardiovascular fitness. Suppose we are interested in answering the question: is the speed of the run (in mph) related to the number of calories burned? Below is the R code and output for fitting such a linear model to this data.<sup>[3]</sup> (25 points)

```{r runOutput, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#run_dat <- read_table2("~/Google Drive Swat/Swat docs/Stat 21/Data/Four-Mile-Run-data.txt")
#run_reg <- lm(calories~aveSpeed, run_dat) 
#run_reg %>% summary
```


a) What is the estimate for the standard deviation of the number of calories burned based on this linear model?

**Solution:** $\hat{\sigma}=30.84$
\vspace{2in}



b) On average, how many more (or fewer) calories can our runner expect to burn for each mph increase in average running speed? 

**Solution:** Can expect to burn an average of $80.92$ additional calories per each increase in mph. 
\vspace{2in}


c) Suppose, on average, for any person within the same age group as our runner, every mph increase in running speed corresponds to $100$ additional calories burnt. Describe a procedure to determine if our runner's rate of burning calories is different from this average for all people in the age group. Make sure you define any symbols you use. You do not need to actually determine the answer, just describe the statistical procedure you would use. 

**Solution:** Either (1)calculate a CI for $\beta_1$, the slope of our runner's model and see if it contains the value $100$ or (2)perform a hypothesis test for $H_0: \beta_1 = 100$ 
\vspace{2in}


d) List two numbers in the R output above that can help us determine if this model is a good fit for the data? Explain each briefly. 

**Solution:** Any of the following options are valid: 

  - R-squared (adjusted or multiple is fine); 

  - p-value of the F-test for model fit; 

  - p-value of the t-test for the significance of the predictor. 

[I will determine if their justifications are sufficient.]
\vspace{2in}



## TO DO

- add question about CI for mean response vs prediction interval for unobserved response 

- add question about influential point and SS terms 

- question to interpret regression standard error in context 

- practical vs statistical significance 

- three ways to test for a linear relationship (test correlation, test slope, anova f test)


From textbook: Throughout the book we discuss tests, intervals, and
effect sizes as a trio of tools used to address three questions: Is there an effect? How
big is the effect? Is the effect big enough to matter.
