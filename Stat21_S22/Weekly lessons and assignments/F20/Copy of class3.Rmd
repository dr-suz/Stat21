# HW 1 Problem 3
## Summary statistics 

- Mean vs median (when to use which?)


--
- Lower and upper quartiles (25th quantile/percentile, 75th quantile/percentile)


--
- Minimum and maximum (the range)


--
- Variance and standard deviation (more measures of spread)

# HW 1 Problem 3
## Summary statistics 

**With your group** use the RMarkdown template for HW 1. The recorder should share their screen (make sure the text is large enough for people to read!) and type in the R code chunk for the solution to Problem 3. 

The reporter should make sure they're ready to describe the distribution of the data (part c). The questioner should make sure to ask questions! (E.g. "how do we know how to read the stem-and-leaf plot?", "how could you calculate the median without using R?", "whats the formula to calculate the standard deviation?") 

The recorder should share a screenshot of your R code (not the output, just the code) with me on Slack. 


**Hint:** Here's how you can enter the data into R: 
```{r eval=FALSE}
my_data <- c(-0.09, -0.09, -0.01, -0.02, -0.03, -0.04, 
             0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.04, 0.04, 
             0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.06, 0.07, 0.09, 
             0.10, 0.10, 0.11, 0.11, 0.13, 1.00, 0.22, 0.25)
```

# Example
## Inference for a proportion 

In New York City on October 23rd, 2014, a doctor who had recently been treating Ebola patients in Guinea went to the hospital with a slight fever and was subsequently diagnosed with Ebola. Soon after, a survey conducted by the Marist Poll, an organization with a carefully designed methodology for drawing random samples from identified populations, found that, out of a sample of size $1042$, $82\%$ of New Yorkers favored a "mandatory 21-day quarantine for anyone who has come in contact with an Ebola patient."

# Example
## Inference for a proportion 

**To do:** 

a) Verify that the sampling distribution of $\hat{p}$ is nearly normal.

b) Construct a $95\%$ confidence interval for $p$, the proportion of New York adults who supported a quarantine for anyone who has come into contact with an Ebola patient. Specifically state the values of $\hat{p}_{obs}$, $z_{\alpha/2}^*$, and $SE(\hat{p})$.  


--
.scroll-small[
```{r}
obs_success <- 1042*0.82
sample_size <- 1042
prop.test(obs_success, sample_size, conf.level = 0.95)
```
]

c) Conduct an $\alpha=0.05$ hypothesis test to answer the question: Do the majority of New York adults support the mandatory quarantine?

# HW 1 Problem 9
## Inference for the difference of proportions 

.scroll-output[It is widely believed that regular mammogram screening may detect breast cancer early, resulting in fewer deaths from that disease. One study that investigated this issue over a period of 18 years was published during the 1970s. Among $30,565$ people with breast tissue who had never had mammograms, $196$ died of breast cancer, while only $153$ of $30,131$ who had undergone screening died of breast cancer.

**With your group** write down a null and alternative hypothesis to test to determine if mammograms are an effective screening tool for reducing breast cancer fatalities. Then use the R code template below to evaluate this hypothesis at any significance level you'd like. The reporter should be prepared to share your conclusion with the class and/or share any unanswered questions. 

The recorder should share a screenshot of your R code (not the output, just the code) with me on Slack.

**Hint:**
```{r eval=FALSE}
obs_success_group1 <- ?
obs_success_group2 <- ?
sample_size_group1 <- ?
sample_size_group2 <- ?
prop.test(c(obs_success_group1, obs_success_group2), 
          c(sample_size_group1, sample_size_group2), ... )
```
]

# HW 1 Problem 5
## Sampling Distributions

**With your group:** Have everyone do an internet search for the term "sampling distribution". Then spend a few minutes discussing what this term means. The questioner should pay careful attention and ask follow-up questions to the proposed/found definitions. The recorder should take note of any unanswered questions and the reporter should be prepared to communicate any answers or unanswered questions back to the class. 



---
## Housekeeping 

- How to submit assignments on Gradescope 

- Requirements for HW problems graded for completeness 

- Re-grade requests (use for tests mainly)


## Planning ahead for next week

- Watch the videos for Week 3 before Tuesday's class.  

- Finish and submit HW 1 before Monday, Feb 22 at 8am EST. (Note, I've changed a little bit of the wording in Problem 4!)

- Check in on the different Slack channels to see if there are any questions you can contribute to.

# Announcements 

[Problem-Solving Skills and Strategies](http://www.swarthmore.edu/NatSci/sthornt1/Stat021/Stat21/S2021/Problem Solving Poster.pdf) 

W+iMS and Swarthmore Problem Solvers are co-sponsoring this workshop on **Today from 3:45-5:00 pm** (EST). 

Come learn about the Putnam competition, about problem-solving techniques, and about making space for women and nonbinary students in the problem solving world. 

Prof. Whitehead will give a presentation on different problem solving strategies. 

W+iMS will be holding space to discuss why these spaces so often feel exclusive.

# Announcements 

**Swat Data Viz group**

Join us each week to analyze a different data set, meet other Swatties, hone your data visualization skills, and build a portfolio. No experience necessary! 

Never used R before? That's okay! This is a supportive, low-stakes environment and perfect for learning at your own pace. 

**Tuesdays 5-5:30pm** (EST) at [this zoom link](https://swarthmore-dot-yamm-track.appspot.com/Redirect?ukey=1F9-nrOEIi9R2t2TNb2WSBm0Ucelzz0d89CTzSeiVUwY-1096690557&key=YAMMID-99960339&link=https%3A%2F%2Fswarthmore.zoom.us%2Fj%2F81874849257%3Fpwd%3DdzM3R1U5YU4rT2t5ZEk1SVVXVjd5dz09) (Meeting ID: 818 7484 9257,  passcode: dataviz). 

You are also welcome to join us asynchronously throughout the week to ask questions and share work via the [Slack group](https://swarthmore-dot-yamm-track.appspot.com/Redirect?ukey=1F9-nrOEIi9R2t2TNb2WSBm0Ucelzz0d89CTzSeiVUwY-1096690557&key=YAMMID-99960339&link=https%3A%2F%2Fjoin.slack.com%2Ft%2Fswat-data-viz%2Fshared_invite%2Fzt-mci5g4s3-_LpMV2J5mYY0zzn~V5Y8DA). 

Future meeting times will be determined based on a slack poll, so be sure to join the group even if Today's meeting time doesn't work for you! 

The group will also have a blog to share our work publicly at https://swatdataviz.com

Have questions? Feel free to reach out to Professor Amanda Luby on Slack or at aluby1@swarthmore.edu
