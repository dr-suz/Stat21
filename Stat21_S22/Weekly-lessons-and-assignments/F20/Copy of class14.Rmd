### SLR 

.scroll-output[
$$Y \mid x = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon, \quad E(\epsilon)=0 \text{ and } Var(\epsilon)=\sigma^2$$


$$E(Y \mid x) = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 x$$


Interpretation 

  - Average response not exact 
  
  - Residuals as approximations to random measurement error 
  
Assumptions about the random measurement error associated with the response variable
  
  - Zero mean - is a freebie, why? 

  - Constant variance  
  
    * Residual plots - residuals vs fitted values 
    
    * Transform the quantitative response or predictor variables if need be 
  
  - Independence 
  
  - Normally distributed measurement error 
    
    * Normal probability plots - of the *standardized* residuals 
    
    * Only necessary for *inference*

### SLR 

$$Y \mid x = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon, \quad E(\epsilon)=0 \text{ and } Var(\epsilon)=\sigma^2$$

$$E(Y \mid x) = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 x$$

Estimation

  - Variance of the random error (and random response)
  
  - Average/predicted response per unit increase in predictor 

Inference 

  - Tests for the "significance of the predictor" 

  - Confidence intervals for the coefficients 
  
  - Confidence intervals for the mean response (later)
  
  - Prediction intervals for an unobserved response (later)

## Group work  
### Part I - Building and interpreting a SLR model 

(Homework 5: Problems 5-10)

The following data set was collected in 2018-2019 and recorded different attributes of skyscrapers in NYC. We are going to investigate how the height (in meters) $(Y)$ of a skyscraper depends on the number of stories (i.e. floors) it has $(x)$. 

```{r}
library('tidyverse')
skyscrapers <- read_csv(
                url("http://www.swarthmore.edu/NatSci/sthornt1/DataFiles/skyscraper_data.csv"))
head(skyscrapers)
```

## Group work  
### Part I - Building and interpreting a SLR model 

.scroll-output[
The following code creates a SLR model for this problem and names the model `SLR_sky`.
```{r}
SLR_sky <- lm(height_meters ~ floors, skyscrapers)
SLR_sky
```

This model contains a lot of different information that is not obvious from the output above:
```{r}
names(SLR_sky)
```


With your group, interpret the output of `summary(SLR_sky)`. Answer the following questions and submit your responses to me on Slack. 

**Question 1:** 

  (a) Write and interpret the estimated regression equation.

  (b) Find a $95\%$ CI for the estimated effect of the number of floors on the height of the building. (Hint: Use the function `confint(SLR_sky, 'floors', level=0.95)`)

  (c) Identify the estimate of the variance of the random error. 

**Question 2:** 

Which assumptions are required to answer each of the questions above? 

**Question 3:** 

How can you evaluate the independence assumption?

## Group work  
### Part II - Interpreting plots for SLR models  

(Homework 5: Problems 5-10)
.scroll-output[

The following code creates a scatterplot of the data and fits the linear regression line over it (as well as a confidence bound on the regression line). 
```{r}
ggplot(skyscrapers, aes(x=floors ,y=height_meters)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method='lm') + 
  labs(title="Skyscraper Data", x="Number of floors", y="Height (in m)")
```
]

---
## Group work  
### Part II - Interpreting plots for SLR models  

.scroll-output[
You can extract the residuals and fitted values from your model with the following code: 
```{r results=FALSE}
SLR_sky$residuals 
SLR_sky$fitted.values
```

Recall you can use the `mutate()` function to add new columns to an existing data object (tibble). 

**Question 1:**

What is the correlation between the variables `floors` and `height_meters`? (Hint: Use the `cor()` function in R.)

**Question 2:**

What is the coefficient of determination? 

**Question 3:**

Use the following code to create a residual plot of the residuals vs the fitted values and interpret. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(?, aes(x=?, y=?)) +
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title="Residuals vs fitted values", x="Fitted values", y="Residuals") +
  geom_hline(yintercept=0)
```

**Question 4:**

Use the following code to create a normal probability plot of the standardized residuals and interpret. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(?, aes(sample=?)) +
  stat_qq() + 
  stat_qq_line() + 
  labs(title="Normal prob plot for the standardized residuals")
```

### Planning ahead for next week  

- Watch the videos for Week 9 before Tuesday's class.  

  * Confidence intervals, prediction intervals for SLR
  
  * Analysis of variance for SLR 
  
  * Transforming data for regression models 
  
  * Introduce multiple linear regression (MLR)

- Finish and submit HW 5 before Monday, April 5th at 8am EST.

### Another Announcement 

Philadelphia Regional Institute for STEM Educators (PRISE) is hosting a speaker and panel series titled: 

[An Inside-Out Approach to Equity in STEM](http://prnp.org/spring-2021-speaker-series-an-inside-out-approach-to-equity-in-stem/) 

We are taking a systems view of examining how individual identity and organizational culture contribute to activities and impacts which are grounded in producing equitable outcomes for STEM learners. We call this an Inside-Out approach because this ultimately is about Cultural Proficiency which, according to Randall Lindsey is “to be applied to both organizational practices and individual behavior” (Cultural Proficiency: A Manual for School Leaders 4th ed., 2019). Over the three sessions we have assembled an impressive line-up of contributors from the Philadelphia region that represent K-12, higher education, and organizations that support STEM education. During each session, one of the speakers will give an overview of the topic at hand and then will join a panel that will be moderated by Muriel Fox Alim from the National Math and Science Initiative.  The audience will have an opportunity to ask questions during a Q&A period at the end. Although each session stands alone, it is recommended that you attend all three to experience the full impact of the series.  


All sessions start at **5:00 pm EST** and end at 6:00 pm EST

**Session Dates:** Tuesday, April 6, 2021; Tuesday, April 20, 2021; Tuesday, May 4, 2021


Registration is required.  To register for any or all of the events, please go to HTTP://BIT.LY/PRISE_EQUITYSERIES
