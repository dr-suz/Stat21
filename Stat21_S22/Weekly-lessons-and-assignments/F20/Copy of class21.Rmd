# Tuesday check-in 

- Send me a screenshot of your check-in markers on Slack

- [Fill out the group roles for today's class](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d34JxqXQON6MyIEjN5ugkByCeTuGTTb_ovvPfSAca_g/edit?usp=sharing)

## Multiple linear regression
### Assumptions 

- Relationship between the response and the set of predictor variables (the regressors) is approximately linear 

- The error term, $\epsilon$, has zero mean 

- The error term has constant variance $\sigma^2$ 

- The errors are independent 

- The errors are Normally distributed

## Multiple linear regression
### (Studentized) Residuals

Residuals measure the deviation between the observed data, $y_{obs}$, and the fitted response, $\hat{y}$. Some properties of residuals are 

1. The mean of the residuals is always zero. 

2. The variance of the residuals is, on average, equal to the $MSE = \frac{SSE}{n-p}$. 

3. The residuals are dependent. (This is mainly a problem when the number of parameters $p$ is close to - or larger than - your sample size, $n$.) 

  - This is one reason we want to use studentized residuals.
  
  - This is also why we plot the residuals, $e_i$, vs the fitted values, $\hat{y}_i$, (rather than the observed $y$ values)           


--
From now on, we are going to use only use plots of the *studentized residuals* 

```{r eval=FALSE}
library("MASS")
studres(mod)  ## this is the function to calculate the studentized residuals of "mod" 
```

---
## Normal probability plots 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.height=500}
knitr::include_graphics("Figs/week12-resid-qq.png")
```

---
## Residual plots 
### Residuals vs fitted values 

- Outliers

- Non-constant variance

- Non-linearity


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center',out.height=300}
knitr::include_graphics("Figs/week12-resid-funnel.png")
```



---
## Residual plots 
### Residuals vs regressors 


- Transformations of predictors (non-linear relationships) 

- Extrapolation 

- Potentially useful additional predictors

## Homework 8 
### Problems 9 and 10 

A solid-fuel rocket propellant loses weight after it is produced. Suppose we want to model the weight loss(in kg) as a function of the number of months since the rocket was produced. Read the following observed data into R using the code below and use this to answer Problems 9-10.

```{r}
rocket_data <- tibble(months = c(0.25,0.50,0.75,1.00,1.25,1.50,1.75,2.00,2.25,2.50),
                      weight_loss = c(1.42,1.39,1.55,1.89,2.43,3.15,4.05,5.15,6.43,7.89))
```

---
## Homework 8 
### Problems 9 and 10 

The code below fits what is called a second-order polynomial regression model to this data.  

```{r}
mod9 <- lm(weight_loss ~ poly(months,2), rocket_data)
```
The regression model here is 
$$Y \mid x = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \beta_2 x^2 + \epsilon,$$
where $Y$ is the weight loss and $x$ is the months since production. 


---
## Homework 8 
### Problems 9 and 10 - Group work 

**Instructions:** With your group, create the following plots based on the second-order polynomial model on the previous slide. 

- a scatter plot of $x$ and $y$; 

- a scatter plot of the studentized residuals and $x$; 

- a plot of the studentized residuals vs the fitted values. 

Discuss whether or not this polynomial model seems to be a good fit based on these plots specifically. 

- **Recorder** keep track of your group's  [progress](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d34JxqXQON6MyIEjN5ugkByCeTuGTTb_ovvPfSAca_g/edit?usp=sharing) and update this sheet if your group has a question. 

- **Questioner** ask about the purpose of each of the plots and whether or not there are more plots we may want to consider. 

- **Reporter** be prepared to report on your group's findings and/or questions when we discuss this as a class.
