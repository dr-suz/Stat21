**1.** A consumer magazine plans to poll car owners to see if they are happy enough with their vehicles that they would purchase the same model again. They randomly selected 450 owners of American-made cars and 450 owners of Japanese models and ask the owners whether or not they are happy with their vehicle (yes/no). 

Suppose we want to make a statistical statement quantifying the difference in owner satisfaction of American versus Japanese cars.

Suppose we want to determine if there is a significant difference in the mean temperatures between January and July.

**3.** The Masterfoods Company claims that yellow candies make up 20% of its milk chocolate M&M's, red another 20%, orange, blue, and green 10% each. The rest are brown. You purchase a bag of plain M&M's and count the number of yellow, red, orange, blue, green, and brown candies.  

Suppose we want to determine if your sample is consistent with the company's stated proportions.

**4.** Hepatitis C causes bout 10,000 deaths each year in the US but often lies undetected for years after infection. A study at a large medical center randomly surveyed visitors over a particular time period. The participants were asked whether or not they had any tattoos and from where (all tattoos from a parlor, at least one tattoo from somewhere besides a parlor, or no tattoos) and were tested to determine if they had hepatitis C or not.  

Suppose we want to test if a hepatitis C infection is related to whether and how people have tattoos.

**5.** Some people think that a full moon elicits unusual behavior in people including increased illegal activities. Suppose we collect data on the number of arrests made in a small town during the weeks of six full moods and six other randomly selected weeks during the same year. For each week we note whether or not there was a full moon and we count the number of arrests for violent crime, property damage, drug offenses, and other offenses. 

Suppose we want to test whether or not there is evidence of a difference in the types of illegal activity that take place during a full moon.

**6.** The Masterfoods Company claims that yellow candies make up 20% of its milk chocolate M&M's, red another 20%, orange, blue, and green 10% each. The rest are brown. Suppose you purchase a bag of plain M&M's and observe 29 yellow ones, 23 red ones, 12 orange, 14 blue, 8 green, and 20 brown. 

Suppose we want to determine if your sample is consistent with the company's stated proportions.

Many drivers of cars that can run on regular gasoline actually buy premium because they think they will get better gas mileage. 

Suppose we want to test this belief and we use 10 cars in a company fleet in which all the cars run on regular gas. Each car is filled first with either regular or premium gas, decided by a coin toss, and the mileage for that tankful is recorded. Then the mileage is recorded again for the same cars for a tankful of the other kind of gas. Drivers are not aware which type of gas is in the car at any given time.

**4.** A Gallup Poll asked 105 US adults if they actively tried to avoid carbohydrates in their diet. The number of positive respondents increased from 20% to 27% over the course of two years. 

Suppose we want to determine if the apparent increase is likely due to random fluctuations in nutritional trends or due to an actual shift in nutrition norms.

**5.** After field tests in 36 high schools over a three-year period, research compared the performances of students taught using a traditional mathematics curriculum to students who were taught using an innovative method developed by the Core Plus Mathematics Project (CPMP). Scores for 320 CPMP students were compared with those of a control group of 273 students in a traditional Math program. 

Suppose we want to determine if students who learn from the CPMP program have significantly higher mean scores than those in traditional programs.
