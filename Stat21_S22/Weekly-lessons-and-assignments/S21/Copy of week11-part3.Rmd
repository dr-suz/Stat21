## SAT model with .blue[three] predictors
### What did we notice? 

- As we increase the number of predictor variables, the R-squared value increases;

- Our estimate for $\sigma$ decreases; 

- The shape of the residuals plot changes;

- The significance of any given predictor variable can change;

- The overall F test changes as well. 


**Q:** Did anything stay the same? 
  

--
**A:** Not really. Either model choice here is different, which means that these models are what statisticians call *non-robust*.

## SAT model with .blue[four] predictors
### What did we notice? 

Again we see the same patterns as before. But note that our interpretation of the individual effects of each variable changes as well!

##R squared
### Why does adding predictor variables increase $R^2$? 

$$R^2 = \frac{SS_{reg}}{SS_{tot}} = 1 - \frac{SS_{res}}{SS_{tot}}$$ 

What is $SS_{res}$? 


--
Recall $Var(\epsilon) = \sigma^2$ and $\hat{\sigma}^2 = \frac{SS_{res}}{n-2}.$


The way we determine the coefficients of our linear model (i.e. the $\hat{\beta}$'s) is by minimizing $SS_{res}$. Mathematically, minimizing $SS_{res}$ is equivalent to maximizing $R^2$. 


So this question can be rephrased as: .red[why does adding more predictor variables decrease] $SS_{res}$?

---
##R squared
### Why does adding more predictor variables decrease $SS_{res}$?

Because we define the regression estimates as the "least squares" estimates. That is, by definition, (in SLR for example)

$$\hat{\beta_0} = \bar{y} + \hat{\beta_1} \bar{x} \\
\hat{\beta_1} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2}$$

are the values that minimize $SS_{res}$, the squared distance between the data and the line. So as we have to estimate more and more $\hat{\beta}$'s, we continue to minimize $SS_{res}$, but we are able to make $SS_{res}$ even smaller than before. The main reason why is the logical fact stated below.

  > If set $S$ has $n$ elements in it, we can find the minimum and the maximum of this set. If we add $t>0$ more elements to the set, it is possible that both the minimum and maximum values are more extreme than they were before.

## R squared
### R - the programming language - output 

In the linear regression output of R we have 

- multiple R squared is the R squared that we define as $R^2 = \frac{SS_{reg}}{SS_{tot}}$; 
  
- adjusted R squared this imposes a penalty on the multiple R squared value that accounts for adding more predictor variables to the model.
