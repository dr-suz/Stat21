## Multiple linear regression
### Assumptions 

- Relationship between the response and the set of predictor variables (the regressors) is approximately linear 

- The error term, $\epsilon$, has zero mean 

- The error term has constant variance $\sigma^2$ 

- The errors are uncorrelated 

- The errors are Normally distributed

### (Studentized) Residuals

Residuals measure the deviation between the observed data, $y_{obs}$, and the fitted response, $\hat{y}$. Some properties of residuals are 

1. The mean of the residuals is always zero. 

2. The variance of the residuals is, on average, equal to the $MSE = \frac{SSE}{n-p}$. 

3. The residuals are correlated. (This is mainly a problem when the number of parameters $p$ is close to - or larger than - your sample size, $n$.) 

  - This is one reason we want to use studentized residuals.
  
  - This is also why we plot the residuals, $e_i$, vs the fitted values, $\hat{y}_i$, (rather than the observed $y$ values)

From now on, we are going to use only use plots of the *studentized residuals* 

```{r eval=FALSE}
library("MASS")
studres(mod)  ## this is the function to calculate the studentized residuals of "mod" 
```

---
## Normal probability plots 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.height=500}
knitr::include_graphics("Figs/week12-resid-qq.png")
```

---
## Residual plots 
### Residuals vs fitted values 

.push-left[
- Outliers

- Non-constant variance

- Non-linearity
]
.pull-right[
```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("Figs/week12-resid-funnel.png")
```
]

### Residuals vs regressors 


- Transformations of predictors (non-linear relationships) 

- Extrapolation 

- Potentially useful additional predictors
