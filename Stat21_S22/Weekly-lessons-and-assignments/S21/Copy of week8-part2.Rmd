## A simple statistical model 

$$Y\mid x = f(x) + \epsilon$$

- $f$ is a smooth function.
  
  - In linear regression, we consider functions with linear coefficients. These coefficients are our model parameters. (I.e. $f$ is just the equation for a line.)

- $x$ is a fixed/known covariate. 

- $\epsilon$ is some random measurement error. Note that, against convention, even though this is a Greek letter, $\epsilon$ represents a **random variable**!

## Simple linear regression


Statistical convention represents a regression line with a intercept, $\beta_0$, and a slope $\beta_1$ so that we have the following **simple linear regression model**:
$$Y\mid x = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon.$$


- $Y$ is the response (output) variable. We assume that there is some random error associated with our observations of $Y$.
- $x$ is a predictor (explanatory, covariate, input) variable. We assume there is **no** random error associated with $x$, i.e. that all values of $x$ are fixed, so it's not a random variable.  
- The behavior of $Y$ is modeled conditional upon the predictor $x$.
- $\beta_{0}$, $\beta_{1}$ are the regression model coefficients (the intercept and slope, respectively). 

***

Compare this to the the typical algebraic notation for the equation of a line: 
$$Y = ax + b.$$

## Simple linear regression 

$$Y \mid x = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon.$$

It's called a linear model because $f$ is linear with respect to the coefficients $\beta_{i}$, for $i=1,2$. 




**Question:** Which of the following are linear models? 

1. $Y = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x^2 + \epsilon$ 

1. $Y = \sqrt{\beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x} + \epsilon$

**Question:** Which of the following are linear models? 

1. $Y = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x^2 + \epsilon$ (this is!)

1. $Y = \sqrt{\beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x} + \epsilon$ (not this!)

## Simple linear regression

$$Y \mid x = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon.$$

For now, we are only going to consider the case where $x$ and $Y$ both represent **quantitative, continuous** random variables.


We will be generalizing this SLR (simple linear regression) model to cases where 

  - X is a discrete and quantitative variable; 
  
  - X is a categorical variable (ANOVA);

  - We have more than just one predictor variable (MLR); 

  - Y is a binary variable (logistic regression) - time permitting.
  


---
## Simple linear regression

In SLR, the data we observe are pairs $(x_{1},y_{1}), \dots, (x_{n},y_{n})$, of continuous, quantitative variables. 

The model $Y \mid x = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon$ means that we are assuming 
$$y_{i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i} + \epsilon_{i},$$
for each data point we observe where $\epsilon_{i}$ represents an (unobserved) measurement error associated with our response variable.

## Simple linear regression

$$Y \mid x = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon$$

**Assumptions**

- For estimation: The measurement error has mean $E[\epsilon]=0$ and (unknown) variance $Var[\epsilon]=\sigma^2$ and all measurement errors are independent of each other.

- For inference: If we wish to conduct statistical inference, we must also assume that the measurement error, $\epsilon$, follows a standard normal distribution. 


--
**Question:** What do theses assumptions imply about $Y$? 


--
**Another question:** What if there was no random error in our observations of $Y$? How do we find the line of best fit in this case?
